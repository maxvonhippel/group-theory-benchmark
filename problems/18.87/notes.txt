KOUROVKA NOTEBOOK PROBLEM 18.87 - SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
18.87. A system of equations with coefficients in a group G is said to be
independent if the matrix composed of the sums of exponents of the unknowns
has rank equal to the number of equations.

a) The Kervaire-Laudenbach Conjecture (KLC): every independent system of
   equations with coefficients in an arbitrary group G has a solution in
   some over-group G-bar.

b) KLC - nilpotent version: every independent system of equations with
   coefficients in an arbitrary nilpotent group G has a solution in some
   nilpotent overgroup G-bar.

c) KLC - solvable version: every independent system of equations with
   coefficients in an arbitrary solvable group G has a solution in some
   solvable overgroup G-bar.

FINDING: Counterexample to Part (c) - Solvable/Metabelian Version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A counterexample to the solvable/metabelian version of KLC was published by
Klyachko, Mikheenko, and Roman'kov in 2024.

THE COUNTEREXAMPLE:

Group G: The metabelian group <c>_7 : <a>_6 with c^a = c^5
         (order 42, derived length 2)

Equation: x * x^(-a) * x^(a^2) = c

Key properties:
- This is a unimodular (independent) equation with exponent sum 1
- c is in the derived subgroup G'
- The equation has NO solution in G

VERIFICATION:
The Python/GAP script disproof.py confirms:
1. G has order 42 and is metabelian (derived length 2)
2. c is in the derived subgroup G'
3. The equation has no solution in G

MATHEMATICAL RESULT:
The referenced paper proves this equation has no solution in ANY metabelian
overgroup of G, thus disproving the KLC for the variety of metabelian groups.
