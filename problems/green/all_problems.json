Of course, one may also ask the question for longer progressions. A set S for which the conclusion of Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s theorem for progressions of length k holds, but with the common difference of the progressions restricted to lie in S, is called a set of (k \u2212 1)-recurrence. Thus Problem 10 is asking for conditions under which a random set is a set of 2-recurrence.\n\nThe most optimistic conjecture here, suggested in [119] and [118, Problem 31] is that if n is chosen to lie in S with probability \u03c9(n)/n, where \u03c9(n) \u2192 \u221e, then S is almost surely a set of r-recurrence for all r \u2a7e 1.\n\nThe best that is known is the result of Bri\u00ebt and Gopi [47], improving on earlier work of Christ and of Frantzikinakis\u2013Lesigne\u2013Wierdl, showing that if P(n \u2208 S) \u226b (\u03c9(n)/log n) \u00b7 n^{\u22121/\u2308k/2\u2309} then Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely as n \u2192 \u221e) with common differences in S.\n\nThe case k = 3 (Roth\u2019s theorem with differences in S) is perhaps the most interesting in the first instance, and here the bound of Bri\u00ebt and Gopi is no stronger than the earlier results.\n\nA particular model problem would be to show that if P(n \u2208 S) = n^{\u22120.51} then Roth\u2019s theorem holds with common difference in S.\n\nUpdate 2023. Bri\u00ebt and Castro-Silva [46] have advanced the bounds for k odd, showing that if P(n \u2208 S) \u226b n^{\u22122/k+o(1)} then Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely) with common differences in S. In particular, they resolve the model problem mentioned here.\n\nIt is a curious fact that, by the Bergelson\u2013Leibman theorem, Roth\u2019s theorem is known with common differences restricted to much sparser sets S, for example S = {1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, . . . }. However, the proof of that theorem seems to crucially exploit the fact that the derivatives of the sequence are eventually constant.\n\nThe conjecture in [118, 119] is motivated by the suggestion that the set of correlation functions of the form \u03c3(d) := E_n 1_A(n)1_A(n + d)1_A(n + 2d) (where here we are taking k = 3 for simplicity) should have \u2018low complexity\u2019, since one expects \u03c3(d) to be approximated in some sense by highly algebraic objects called nilsequences. However, recent examples of Bri\u00ebt-Labib [49] and Bri\u00ebt and me [48] show that the situation in that regard is more complicated than previously thought. Those examples do not, however, seem to impact on Problem 10 itself.\n\nFinally we remark that Altman [10] has also shown that in finite field models the random set S must be significantly larger for Roth\u2019s theorem with common differences in S to hold.",

On the other hand I have observed (unpublished) that by arguments of Bourgain, progress for \u03b1 \u2248 1 would imply the Kakeya conjecture.\nTo conclude these remarks, let me mention a toy problem related to the way in which pairs of residue classes a(p1) (mod p1) and a(p2) (mod p2) interact. It came up from a study of Problem 48, but seems to be concerned with the same phenomena that apparently make Problem 43 hard. Suppose that for all primes p with X \u2a7d p < 2X one has a residue class a(p) (mod p). For distinct primes p1, p2 in this range, let f(p1, p2) \u2208 Z/p1p2Z be the unique solution to f(p1, p2) \u2261 a(pi) (mod pi), i = 1, 2. What can be said about the function a if |E_{X\u2a7dp\u2a7d2X} e( f(p1,p2) / (p1p2) )| \u2a7e 0.99?\nPerhaps a() must be almost constant. More ambitiously, one could replace 0.99 by 0.01 or even smaller quantities."

There is an absolutely vast literature on \u2018arcs\u2019, which is the name given to sets with no-three in a line. However, I could not find this question asked, or really even hinted at, in that literature, which is more concerned with exact quantities for small p. I asked it myself in [137]. It is more natural to formulate the question in projective space.\n\nThe largest no-3-in-a-line set (arc) is a conic of size p + O(1), and Voloch [278], building on work of Segre, showed that any arc of size > 44/45 p lies in a conic. Below the threshold 1/2 p there are genuinely cubic examples. The would-be solver should also note that the result is false in F_q with q = p^2, where there exist \u2018hermitian quadrics\u2019.\n\nThere are many further problems on no-three-in-a-line sets, on which one would expect a positive solution to Problem 68 to shed some light. One of my favourites is the following. Denoting by f_d(p) the size of the largest no-three-in-a-line set in F^d_p, one has f_2(p) \u223c p and f_3(p) \u223c p^2. Is f_4(p) = o(p^3), or even O(p^{2+o(1)})? The point here is that in dimension 4 and above, low-dimensional algebraic examples are forced to contain whole lines. All that is known is a slight improvement f_4(p) \u2a7d (1 \u2212 c)p^3 on the trivial bound, due to Nagy and Sz\u0151nyi [212].\n\nAnother problem is to determine the largest subset of F^2_p with no four on a line; at the moment there is a factor of 2 discrepancy between the lower bounds of (1 + o(1))p and the upper bound (2 + o(1))p."

Despite initial appearances, it has a very different flavour to, for example, Problem 68, as lines meeting the grid [N]2 often contain very few points. For a bibliography, see [152, Problem F4]. In particular, we note that there do exist such configurations of 2N points for N up to around 50. It was shown in [155] that for arbitrary N one can have ( 3\n2 + o(1))N such points, and my personal suspicion is that this is optimal. It is possible that any no-three-in-a-line subset of [N]2 is either small, or has a large subset which reduces (mod p) to a set of points on a curve in\nF2\np. It might be interesting to formulate a precise conjecture of this type and see\nwhether it can be used to show that the construction of [155] is optimal.

This is an arithmetic variant of an open question in graph theory raised by Conlon and Fox [72, Lemma 3.6]. In that lemma, they show that every graph G on n vertices contains an \u03b5-regular subset on n\u2032 vertices, where n\u2032/n \u2a7e 2^{\u2212\u03b5\u2212(10/\u03b5)^4}, and they go on to say \u2018while our bound gives a double exponential dependence, we suspect that the truth is more likely to be a single exponential. We leave this as an open problem.\u2019\n\nManners showed that one can have such a V of codimension exponential in 1/\u03b5. In the other direction, there are examples to show that the codimension must grow like a power of 1/\u03b5."

However (personal communication) they believe it is possible that the result is true with 99 percent replaced by 100 percent.

Chase [61] has improved this to e^{n^{1/5} log^C n}.\nSimple examples (see [21, \u00a74.2]) show that m must grow at least linearly in n, and very recently Zachary Chase [60], improving on work of Holden and Lyons [162], improved this to m \u2a7e n^{3/2}(log n)^{\u221216}.\nA related wide-open problem is that of reconstruction a binary string of length n from the multiset of all (n choose k) substrings of length k, the so-called k-deck.

    "problem_text": "Problem 96. Is every set \u039b \u2282 Z either a Sidon set, or a set of analyticity?\nComments. This problem, known as the Dichotomy Problem, was raised in the 1960s in the subject of commutative harmonic analysis. It is important to note that the notion of Sidon set here is not the one featured in Section 4, but rather the harmonic analysis notion: \u039b is Sidon if and only if the Fourier algebra A(\u039b) = {(\\hat f(\u03bb))_{\u03bb\u2208\u039b} : f \u2208 L^1(T)} coincides with c0(\u039b), the algebra of sequences tending to zero. By contrast, \u039b is a set of analyticity if only analytic functions F act on A(\u039b). Much of the classical literature on these problems is difficult to penetrate for a modern reader (at least, it is for me). For more on the problem, I recommend, at least to the reader with passable French, the relatively recent paper of Kahane and Katznelson [170].\nIn that paper they show that a random set \u039b in which P(n \u2208 \u039b) = p_n is almost surely Sidon if n p_n is bounded, and almost surely a set of analyticity if n p_n \u2192 \u221e.\nA beautiful open question is whether every Sidon subset of Z (in the commutative harmonic analysis sense) is a finite union of independent sets, that is to say sets A \u2282 Z, all of whose finite subset sums are distinct (for example, the powers of two).\nIn celebrated work from the 1980s, Pisier [225] showed that S \u2282 Z is Sidon if and only if it has the following property (\u22c6): there is a \u03b4 > 0 such that, if S\u2032 \u2282 S is finite, then S\u2032 contains an independent set A with |A| \u2a7e \u03b4|S\u2032|. The open question is then the completely combinatorial question of whether every set with property (\u22c6) is a finite union of independent sets. I should say that I am not sufficiently expert on these topics to say with any certainty what the relationship (if any) between this question and the dichotomy problem is.\nI included this problem here in memory of Jean Bourgain, who once told me he considered it a beautiful open question, and lamented that it might never be solved since to a large extent the subject had fallen out of fashion. Let me conclude these comments with another question of Bourgain, asked to P\u00e9ter Varj\u00fa in 2013 [288]:\nIs it possible to find n points in the unit square such that the 1/n-neighborhood of any line contains no more than C of them for some absolute constant C?
