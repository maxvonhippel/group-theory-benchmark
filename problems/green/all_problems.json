    "problem_text": "Problem 10. Let S ⊂ N be random. Under what conditions is Roth’s theorem for progressions of length 3 true with common differences in S?\n\nComments. Of course, one may also ask the question for longer progressions. A set S for which the conclusion of Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds, but with the common difference of the progressions restricted to lie in S, is called a set of (k − 1)-recurrence. Thus Problem 10 is asking for conditions under which a random set is a set of 2-recurrence.\n\nThe most optimistic conjecture here, suggested in [119] and [118, Problem 31] is that if n is chosen to lie in S with probability ω(n)/n, where ω(n) → ∞, then S is almost surely a set of r-recurrence for all r ⩾ 1.\n\nThe best that is known is the result of Briët and Gopi [47], improving on earlier work of Christ and of Frantzikinakis–Lesigne–Wierdl, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ (ω(n)/log n) · n^{−1/⌈k/2⌉} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely as n → ∞) with common differences in S.\n\nThe case k = 3 (Roth’s theorem with differences in S) is perhaps the most interesting in the first instance, and here the bound of Briët and Gopi is no stronger than the earlier results.\n\nA particular model problem would be to show that if P(n ∈ S) = n^{−0.51} then Roth’s theorem holds with common difference in S.\n\nUpdate 2023. Briët and Castro-Silva [46] have advanced the bounds for k odd, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ n^{−2/k+o(1)} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely) with common differences in S. In particular, they resolve the model problem mentioned here.\n\nIt is a curious fact that, by the Bergelson–Leibman theorem, Roth’s theorem is known with common differences restricted to much sparser sets S, for example S = {1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, . . . }. However, the proof of that theorem seems to crucially exploit the fact that the derivatives of the sequence are eventually constant.\n\nThe conjecture in [118, 119] is motivated by the suggestion that the set of correlation functions of the form σ(d) := E_n 1_A(n)1_A(n + d)1_A(n + 2d) (where here we are taking k = 3 for simplicity) should have ‘low complexity’, since one expects σ(d) to be approximated in some sense by highly algebraic objects called nilsequences. However, recent examples of Briët-Labib [49] and Briët and me [48] show that the situation in that regard is more complicated than previously thought. Those examples do not, however, seem to impact on Problem 10 itself.\n\nFinally we remark that Altman [10] has also shown that in finite field models the random set S must be significantly larger for Roth’s theorem with common differences in S to hold."

Of course one may ask more general questions – for example, for reasonable bounds for the polynomial Szemerédi theorem of Bergelson and Leib-man in general. Peluse [217] has obtained the first quantitative bounds (of shape N(log log N)−c, c = c(p1, . . . , pk)) for configurations (x+p1(d), . . . , x+pk(d)) where the pi have distinct degrees. The case of configurations (x, x + d, x + d2) was previously handled by Peluse and Prendiville [219]. In this case (and in the more general cases covered by Peluse’s work) it is in fact plausible that every set of size N 0.99 contains such a configuration – no counterexample to this appears to be known. However, this is not currently known even for the subconfiguration (x, x + d2), a problem discussed in more detail below (Problem 65).\nFinally let me remark that Prendiville [231] has obtained bounds for certain special cases.

Is W(k, r) a polynomial in r, for fixed k? Is W(3, r) ≪ r2?\nComments. I initially heard this question from Ron Graham, and I was certain that the answer should be no, for the following reason: Colour the points of a Behrend set in [n] of size ∼ ne−c√log n red, and the complement blue. One maybe expects this Behrend set to look in certain ways like a random set, in which case there should not be any blue progressions of length longer than ∼ ec√log n or so. However, this expectation is entirely wrong: the complement of any Behrend set in fact contains extremely long progressions, and I was not able to modify the construction (or any other construction) to get around this. I now believe that the answer to this question may be affirmative.\nFor numerical work on the problem, see [5]. Here, the exact value of W(3, r) is obtained for r ⩽ 19, and conjectured values are given for 20 ⩽ r ⩽ 30. It is observed that we do not have W(3, r) ⩽ r2, the first counterexample being r = 24.

It remains an interesting open problem to actually write down a colouring showing (say) W(3, r) ⩾ 2r2 for some r.

One can make many other related conjectures. One of my favourites is raised in [9]: if A ⊂ Z/pZ is a set of size ⌊p/2⌋, does some dilate of A have no gaps of length more than p^0.49? To see the relation to problems of the type considered here, note that the complement of such a set would have to have a progression of length p^0.49, for each common difference d ∈ (Z/pZ)^∗.\nA minor variant of Problem 43 asks the same, but now with p allowed to vary in a range such as N^0.51 ⩽ p < N^0.52. Obtaining a lower bound N^{1−o(1)} here is certainly no harder than Problem 43, but I do not know how to do it. In fact, for this problem there may even be a lower bound of cN.\nOne can of course ask similar questions with 0.51 replaced by other exponents α.\nFor α < 1/2 these questions are straightforward by an inclusion exclusion or Cauchy-Schwarz argument, for much the same reason that it is relatively easy to establish the Kakeya conjecture in the plane. On the other hand I have observed (unpublished) that by arguments of Bourgain, progress for α ≈ 1 would imply the Kakeya conjecture.\nTo conclude these remarks, let me mention a toy problem related to the way in which pairs of residue classes a(p1) (mod p1) and a(p2) (mod p2) interact. It came up from a study of Problem 48, but seems to be concerned with the same phenomena that apparently make Problem 43 hard. Suppose that for all primes p with X ⩽ p < 2X one has a residue class a(p) (mod p). For distinct primes p1, p2 in this range, let f(p1, p2) ∈ Z/p1p2Z be the unique solution to f(p1, p2) ≡ a(pi) (mod pi), i = 1, 2. What can be said about the function a if |E_{X⩽p⩽2X} e( f(p1,p2) / (p1p2) )| ⩾ 0.99?\nPerhaps a() must be almost constant.

This has been considered one of the biggest open question in the subject and it may be asked for finite fields and over the integers.\nOver finite fields, the question is simpler to state and it is natural to make the following ‘Polynomial Gowers Inverse Conjecture’. Fix an integer s ⩾ 1, and let p > s. Suppose that f : F^n_p → C is a function with |f(x)| ⩽ 1 for all x, and that ∥f∥_{U^{s+1}} ⩾ δ (the definition of the Gowers norm may be found in several places, including the works cited below). Then there is a form ψ of degree s such that |E_{x∈F^n_p} f(x)e(−2πiψ(x)/p)| ≫ δ^{O_s(1)}. Such a statement is not known for any s ⩾ 2. Indeed, it was shown independently by Tao and me [149] and by Lovett [197] that the case s = 2 of this assertion is equivalent to Marton’s Conjecture (Problem 49) for F^n_p. Update 2023. Polynomially effective bounds for the case s = 2 are now known as a consequence of the solution of Marton’s conjecture in [127, 128].\nFor s = 3, quantitative bounds (of double exponential type) were obtained by Gowers and Milićević [129], but for s ⩾ 4 only qualitative bounds are known, from remarkable work of Bergelson, Tao and Ziegler [27].\nIn the case s = 3, the problem is very closely related to the following attractive question. Suppose that f : F^n_p → Mat_n(F_p) is a map with image in the n × n matrices over F_p, and that rank(f(x + y) − f(x) − f(y)) ⩽ r for all x, y. Is there a linear map f̃ : F^n_p → Mat_n(F_p) with f − f̃ taking values in the matrices of rank at most 10r (say)?

This was asked by Erdős, several times I think, but certainly in a collection [102] from 1981 one finds the following problem, which is essentially equivalent: ‘An old conjecture of mine states that if f(n) is the least integer not of the form a + b with P(a, b) ⩽ n then for every k and for n > n0(k) we have f(n) > n^k. This conjecture does not look hard but I could not get anywhere with it’.\nThe reason that the problem ‘does not look hard’ is perhaps that the set of integers less than N, all of whose prime factors are at most N^ε, has positive density (depending on ε). However, the problem seems closely related to other notorious binary problems such as the Goldbach conjecture. I believe the record is still Balog’s exponent 4/9√e ≈ 0.2695, obtained 30 years ago in [14].\nTrevor Wooley has pointed out the following, which he says is well-known. If p ≡ 3 (mod 4), and if p is the sum of two p^ε-smooth numbers, then there is some quadratic non-residue mod p of size at most p^ε. Thus, to answer the problem for all ε > 0 is at least as hard as the notorious Vinogradov least quadratic non-residue problem (at least, the version of that problem restricted to primes p ≡ 3 (mod 4)). The best unconditional exponent for that problem is 1/4√e, which is therefore a serious barrier for our problem. That said, the Vinogradov problem is known under GRH, so it may also be interesting to explore our problem with that assumption."

There is an absolutely vast literature on ‘arcs’, which is the name given to sets with no-three in a line. However, I could not find this question asked, or really even hinted at, in that literature, which is more concerned with exact quantities for small p. I asked it myself in [137]. It is more natural to formulate the question in projective space.\n\nThe largest no-3-in-a-line set (arc) is a conic of size p + O(1), and Voloch [278], building on work of Segre, showed that any arc of size > 44/45 p lies in a conic. Below the threshold 1/2 p there are genuinely cubic examples. The would-be solver should also note that the result is false in F_q with q = p^2, where there exist ‘hermitian quadrics’.\n\nThere are many further problems on no-three-in-a-line sets, on which one would expect a positive solution to Problem 68 to shed some light. One of my favourites is the following. Denoting by f_d(p) the size of the largest no-three-in-a-line set in F^d_p, one has f_2(p) ∼ p and f_3(p) ∼ p^2. Is f_4(p) = o(p^3), or even O(p^{2+o(1)})? The point here is that in dimension 4 and above, low-dimensional algebraic examples are forced to contain whole lines. All that is known is a slight improvement f_4(p) ⩽ (1 − c)p^3 on the trivial bound, due to Nagy and Szőnyi [212].\n\nAnother problem is to determine the largest subset of F^2_p with no four on a line; at the moment there is a factor of 2 discrepancy between the lower bounds of (1 + o(1))p and the upper bound (2 + o(1))p."

This is the ‘inverse Littlewood problem’; Littlewood conjectured, and McGehee-Pigno-Smith and Konyagin indepently proved, that ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ≫ log n. It is natural to conjecture that A has symmetric difference o(n) with a ± combination of O_K(1) characteristic functions of progressions. More precise conclusions should presumably be possible, but one has to be careful: for instance, if P is a 2-dimensional progression with sidelength ∼ e^{\\sqrt{log n}} then ‖\\widehat{1_S}‖_1 ≪ log n.\n\nA solution to this problem would be extremely relevant to Problem 1, as mentioned there, as well as to the further problems (1.1), (1.2) mentioned in the remarks to that problem. It may also be relevant (and it would be good to have a formal deduction of this type) to the currently unresolved Strong Littlewood Conjecture, which states that ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ⩾ (1+o(1))‖\\widehat{1_P}‖_1 = (4/π^2 + o(1)) log n, where P is a progression of length n. (In fact, I believe that the even stronger statement ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ⩾ ‖\\widehat{1_P}‖_1 is thought to hold.)\n\nThere are also interesting questions of this type in finite fields. For example, if A ⊂ F_2^n has ∑_r |\\widehat{1_A}(r)| ⩽ M then Sanders [250] showed 1_A is a ± sum of exp(M^{3+o(1)}) indicator functions of cosets. However, the true dependence may well be polynomial.\n\nLet us also mention the ‘Littlewood–Gowers problem’: if A ⊂ Z/pZ has density 1/2, what is the smallest possible value of ∑_r |\\widehat{1_A}(r)|? The example of an arithmetic progression shows that it can be ≪ log p, but the best known lower bound is ≫ (log p)^{1/2−ε}, due to Sanders [247]."

It can be formulated as a question about the maximum independent set in a graph on vertex set [n]^3 in which two vertices x, y are joined if x, y are not comparable, which means that (x1, x2, x3) is joined to (for example) all (x1, x′2, x′3) with x′2 < x2 and x′3 > x3.

This problem, known as the Dichotomy Problem, was raised in the 1960s in the subject of commutative harmonic analysis. It is important to note that the notion of Sidon set here is not the one featured in Section 4, but rather the harmonic analysis notion: Λ is Sidon if and only if the Fourier algebra A(Λ) = {(\\hat f(λ))_{λ∈Λ} : f ∈ L^1(T)} coincides with c0(Λ), the algebra of sequences tending to zero. By contrast, Λ is a set of analyticity if only analytic functions F act on A(Λ). Much of the classical literature on these problems is difficult to penetrate for a modern reader (at least, it is for me). For more on the problem, I recommend, at least to the reader with passable French, the relatively recent paper of Kahane and Katznelson [170].\nIn that paper they show that a random set Λ in which P(n ∈ Λ) = p_n is almost surely Sidon if n p_n is bounded, and almost surely a set of analyticity if n p_n → ∞.\nA beautiful open question is whether every Sidon subset of Z (in the commutative harmonic analysis sense) is a finite union of independent sets, that is to say sets A ⊂ Z, all of whose finite subset sums are distinct (for example, the powers of two).\nIn celebrated work from the 1980s, Pisier [225] showed that S ⊂ Z is Sidon if and only if it has the following property (⋆): there is a δ > 0 such that, if S′ ⊂ S is finite, then S′ contains an independent set A with |A| ⩾ δ|S′|. The open question is then the completely combinatorial question of whether every set with property (⋆) is a finite union of independent sets. I should say that I am not sufficiently expert on these topics to say with any certainty what the relationship (if any) between this question and the dichotomy problem is.\nI included this problem here in memory of Jean Bourgain, who once told me he considered it a beautiful open question, and lamented that it might never be solved since to a large extent the subject had fallen out of fashion. Let me conclude these comments with another question of Bourgain, asked to Péter Varjú in 2013 [288]:\nIs it possible to find n points in the unit square such that the 1/n-neighborhood of any line contains no more than C of them for some absolute constant C?
