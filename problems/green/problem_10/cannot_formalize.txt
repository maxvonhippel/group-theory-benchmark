This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended meta-question asking "under what conditions" a certain theorem holds, rather than stating a specific mathematical conjecture to prove. The problem asks for a characterization of when Roth's theorem holds with random differences, which is fundamentally asking for research-level criteria that are not yet fully understood. While specific conjectures mentioned in the comments (like the ω(n)/n probability condition) could potentially be formalized individually, the problem itself is asking what the right conditions are, not whether a particular condition suffices.
