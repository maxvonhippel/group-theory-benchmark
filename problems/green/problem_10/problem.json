  "problem_text": "Problem 10. Let S ⊂ N be random. Under what conditions is Roth’s theorem for progressions of length 3 true with common differences in S?\n\nComments. Of course, one may also ask the question for longer progressions. A set S for which the conclusion of Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds, but with the common difference of the progressions restricted to lie in S, is called a set of (k − 1)-recurrence. Thus Problem 10 is asking for conditions under which a random set is a set of 2-recurrence.\n\nThe most optimistic conjecture here, suggested in [119] and [118, Problem 31] is that if n is chosen to lie in S with probability ω(n)/n, where ω(n) → ∞, then S is almost surely a set of r-recurrence for all r ⩾ 1.\n\nThe best that is known is the result of Briët and Gopi [47], improving on earlier work of Christ and of Frantzikinakis–Lesigne–Wierdl, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ (ω(n)/log n) · n^{−1/⌈k/2⌉} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely as n → ∞) with common differences in S.\n\nThe case k = 3 (Roth’s theorem with differences in S) is perhaps the most interesting in the first instance, and here the bound of Briët and Gopi is no stronger than the earlier results.\n\nA particular model problem would be to show that if P(n ∈ S) = n^{−0.51} then Roth’s theorem holds with common difference in S.\n\nUpdate 2023. Briët and Castro-Silva [46] have advanced the bounds for k odd, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ n^{−2/k+o(1)} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely) with common differences in S. In particular, they resolve the model problem mentioned here.\n\nIt is a curious fact that, by the Bergelson–Leibman theorem, Roth’s theorem is known with common differences restricted to much sparser sets S, for example S = {1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, . . . }. However, the proof of that theorem seems to crucially exploit the fact that the derivatives of the sequence are eventually constant.\n\nThe conjecture in [118, 119] is motivated by the suggestion that the set of correlation functions of the form σ(d) := E_n 1_A(n)1_A(n + d)1_A(n + 2d) (where here we are taking k = 3 for simplicity) should have ‘low complexity’, since one expects σ(d) to be approximated in some sense by highly algebraic objects called nilsequences. However, recent examples of Briët-Labib [49] and Briët and me [48] show that the situation in that regard is more complicated than previously thought. Those examples do not, however, seem to impact on Problem 10 itself.\n\nFinally we remark that Altman [10] has also shown that in finite field models the random set S must be significantly larger for Roth’s theorem with common differences in S to hold."
