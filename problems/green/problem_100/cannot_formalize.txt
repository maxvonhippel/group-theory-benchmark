This problem cannot be formalized because: (1) The problem statement is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence while defining the hyperlinearity condition ("there is some unitary group U(n)..." with no continuation). (2) The concepts of "sofic group" and "hyperlinear group" are not defined in Mathlib, and the problem does not provide complete formal definitions. (3) Without the complete mathematical definition of the approximation condition, there is no way to create an accurate formalization.
