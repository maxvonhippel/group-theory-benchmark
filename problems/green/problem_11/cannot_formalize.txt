This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "find reasonable bounds" for maximal densities, which is an open-ended research task rather than a precise mathematical statement. The word "reasonable" is subjective, and the problem does not specify what form the bounds should take. Different partial results mentioned in the updates give various types of bounds (e.g., N(log log N)^{-c}, Ne^{-(log log log N)^c}), demonstrating that this is about discovering and improving bounds rather than proving a fixed theorem.
