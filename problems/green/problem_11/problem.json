  "problem_text": "Problem 11. (Mostly solved) Find reasonable bounds for the maximal density of a set A ⊂ {1, . . . , N} not containing:\n(i) A 3-term progression with common difference a square minus one;\n(ii) A 3-term progression with common difference a prime minus one.\nComments. Of course one may ask more general questions – for example, for reasonable bounds for the polynomial Szemerédi theorem of Bergelson and Leib-man in general. Peluse [217] has obtained the first quantitative bounds (of shape N(log log N)−c, c = c(p1, . . . , pk)) for configurations (x+p1(d), . . . , x+pk(d)) where the pi have distinct degrees. The case of configurations (x, x + d, x + d2) was previously handled by Peluse and Prendiville [219]. In this case (and in the more general cases covered by Peluse’s work) it is in fact plausible that every set of size N 0.99 contains such a configuration – no counterexample to this appears to be known. However, this is not currently known even for the subconfiguration (x, x + d2), a problem discussed in more detail below (Problem 65).\nFinally let me remark that Prendiville [231] has obtained bounds for certain special cases. He showed that if A ⊂ [N] contains no x, x + d2, x + 2d2 then |A| ≪ N(log log N)−c.\nUpdate 2021. Concerning (ii), Tao and Teräväinen [272, Theorem 1.8] established an upper bound of Ne−(log log log N)c.\nUpdate 2023. Depending on one’s definition of ‘reasonable’, problem (i) has been resolved by Peluse, Sah and Sawhney [220], who obtain an upper bound N(logm N)−1 for this problem (where the notation means the m-fold iterated log-arithm, and their method gives m ∼ 200). They indicate that ‘plausible improvements in the quantitative aspects of the theory of nilsequences’ should yield the significantly better bound Ne−(log log N)c, which I would certainly concede is ‘reasonable’ in the context of these problems."
