This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open question rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks "Does A contain at least..." which is inquiring whether a result is true, not asserting it. Additionally, the statement involves asymptotic notation (o(N) for Fourier uniformity and the Vinogradov ≫ notation) that implicitly refers to behavior as N → ∞, making it about families of sets rather than a single set. The exponent 100 appears to be a placeholder or conjecture (the comments note that 4.01 fails), so the problem is really asking for the correct threshold exponent, which is a research question not a formalizable theorem.
