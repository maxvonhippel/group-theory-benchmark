  "problem_text": "Problem 14. (Solved) Define the 2-colour van der Waerden numbers W(k, r) to be the least quantities such that if {1, . . . , W(k, r)} is coloured red and blue then there is either a red k-term progression or a blue r-term progression. Is W(k, r) a polynomial in r, for fixed k? Is W(3, r) ≪ r2?\nComments. I initially heard this question from Ron Graham, and I was certain that the answer should be no, for the following reason: Colour the points of a Behrend set in [n] of size ∼ ne−c√log n red, and the complement blue. One maybe expects this Behrend set to look in certain ways like a random set, in which case there should not be any blue progressions of length longer than ∼ ec√log n or so. However, this expectation is entirely wrong: the complement of any Behrend set in fact contains extremely long progressions, and I was not able to modify the construction (or any other construction) to get around this. I now believe that the answer to this question may be affirmative.\nFor numerical work on the problem, see [5]. Here, the exact value of W(3, r) is obtained for r ⩽ 19, and conjectured values are given for 20 ⩽ r ⩽ 30. It is observed that we do not have W(3, r) ⩽ r2, the first counterexample being r = 24. I am told that in forthcoming work of Aaronson, Even-Zohar, Fox, Peluse, Sauermann, Taczala and S. Walker it will be shown that W(3, r) ≫ r2.\nUpdate 2021. I [140] resolved this question in the negative by proving a lower bound of shape W(3, r) ≫ ec(log r)4/3−o(1). This was subsequently improved to W(3, r) ≫ ec(log r)2−o(1) by Hunter [163], a bound which is plausibly very close to the truth. Note that the work of Kelley and Meka [180] gives a corresponding upper bound W(3, r) ≪ eC(log r)C. It remains an interesting open problem to actually write down a colouring showing (say) W(3, r) ⩾ 2r2 for some r. One might think that simulations of the (probabilistic) approach in [140] or [163] would achieve this, but this does not seem computationally straightforward.",
  "answer": "Resolved in the negative (Update 2021): Green proved W(3, r) ≫ e^{c (\\log r)^{4/3} - o(1)}; improved by Hunter to W(3, r) ≫ e^{c (\\log r)^2 - o(1)}."
