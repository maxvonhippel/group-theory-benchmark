  "problem_text": "Problem 16. What is the largest subset of [N] with no solution to x+3y = 2z+2w in distinct integers x, y, z, w?\nComments. This question was asked by Ruzsa [239, Section 9]. Writing f(N) for the number in question, so far as I know the best bounds known are N^{1/2} ≪ f(N) ≪ Ne^{-c(log N)^{1/7}}, the lower bound being in Ruzsa’s paper and the upper bound being due to Schoen and Sisask [253] (see in particular Section 9 of their paper).\nIn a somewhat similar vein, Yufei Zhao (personal communication) asked me whether there is a subset of {1, . . . , N} of size N^{1/3-o(1)} with no nontrivial solutions to x + 2y + 3z = x′ + 2y′ + 3z′."
