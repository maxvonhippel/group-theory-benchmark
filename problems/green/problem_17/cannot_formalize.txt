This problem cannot be formalized because it consists of two open-ended research questions rather than specific mathematical statements. The first question asks "under what conditions on α" a property holds, which is asking for the characterization of sufficient conditions rather than asking to prove a specific theorem. The second question asks whether a specific asymptotic bound (≫ α^6 n progressions) holds in general, but the problem text itself notes this is only known for S_n-invariant sets, making it an open conjecture rather than a statement to formalize.
