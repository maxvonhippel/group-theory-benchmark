This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "find reasonable bounds" for the multidimensional Szemerédi theorem, which is a request for mathematical discovery/research rather than a specific conjecture to verify. Additionally, "reasonable" is subjective and the problem does not specify which particular bounds (upper vs lower, for which dimension, for which configurations) are sought.
