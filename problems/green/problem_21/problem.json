  "problem_text": "Problem 21. Suppose that a1, . . . , ak are integers which do not satisfy Rado’s condition: thus if ∑_{i∈I} ai = 0 then I = ∅. It then follows from Rado’s theorem that the equation a1x1 + · · · + akxk is not partition regular. Write c(a1, . . . , ak) for the least number of colours required in order to colour N so that there is no monochromatic solution to a1x1 + · · · + akxk = 0. Is c(a1, . . . , ak) bounded in terms of k only?\n\nComments. This problem, which is known as Rado’s boundedness conjecture, dates back to 1933 [232]. The answer was shown to be affirmative for k = 3 by Fox and Kleitman [116], who showed that c(a1, a2, a3) ⩽ 24 (I am not sure this is sharp; it might be interesting to determine the sharp constant). It is open for all k ⩾ 4. Let me also highlight a question [116, Conjecture 5] of Fox and Kleitman, which they call a ‘modular analogue’ of Rado’s Boundedness Conjecture. Let p be a prime, and suppose that a1, . . . , ak are integers with ∑_{i∈I} ai ≡ 0 (mod p) only when I = ∅. Does there exist an f(k)-colouring of (Z/pZ)∗ with no monochromatic solution to a1x1 + · · · + akxk = 0? This seems to be open even when k = 3; I suspect the answer may be negative.\n\nMilićević [94, Conjecture 11.1] conjectures the following 2-adic variant. For any k ∈ N, there exists K = K(k) such that the following is true. Let r be a positive integer, and let a1, . . . , ak ∈ Z/2^r Z. Let d be the largest integer such that ∑_{i∈I} ai ≡ 0 (mod 2^d) for some non-empty subset I ⊂ [k]. Then there is a K-colouring of Z/2^r Z such that all monochromatic solutions x = (x1, . . . , xk) to the equation a1x1 + · · · + akxk = 0 satisfy xi ≡ 0 (mod 2^{r−d}) for all i = 1, . . . , k. Milićević remarks that, if true, this would imply the Rado boundedness conjecture by a compactness argument."
