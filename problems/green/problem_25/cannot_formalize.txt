This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended classification question asking "for which values of k" a property holds. The problem seeks to characterize the boundary between k where the sumset covering property holds versus fails, which is still an open research question (only bounds like k ≪ log log N and k ≫ N/log N are known). A proper formalization would require knowing the exact answer to state as a theorem, rather than the question itself being formalizable as a single Lean statement.
