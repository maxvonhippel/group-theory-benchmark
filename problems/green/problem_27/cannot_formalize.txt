This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended classification question asking "for which values of k" a certain property holds, rather than stating a specific conjecture to prove or disprove. The comments indicate the complete answer is unknown (only partial bounds k ≪ log log N and k ≫ N/log N are known), so there is no precise mathematical statement to formalize. A formalization would require knowing the exact threshold characterizing valid k values, which remains an open problem.
