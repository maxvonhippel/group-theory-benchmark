For the definition of K-approximate group, see for example [136]. Such a conclusion is known with |S| ≫K |A| (but not with a polynomial bound) by an argument of Sanders. See [44, Problem 6.5].\nShachar Lovett once mentioned to me the following vaguely related question: suppose that A ⊂ F^n_2 is a set of density 1/3. Is there a set B with 4B := B + B + B + B ⊂ A + A, and with 4B having density at least 1/100 in F^n_2?"
