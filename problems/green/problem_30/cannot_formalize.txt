This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "find" structured subsets with certain properties, rather than stating a precise theorem to prove. The problem explicitly uses vague terms like "structured" and "'obviously'" (in quotes), and the comments indicate this is a research direction ("one can imagine a more general such result") rather than a concrete conjecture. While the example result from Eberhard-Manners-Green could be formalized separately, Problem 30 itself is asking for new constructions and generalizations, not verification of a specific statement.
