This problem cannot be properly formalized because it asks to "improve" existing bounds on F(N), the maximum size of a Sidon subset of [N]. This is an open research challenge requesting better results rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The problem asks for progress on bounds N^{1/2} + O(1) ≤ F(N) ≤ N^{1/2} + N^{1/4} + O(1), but does not specify what improvement to prove. While one could formalize the known bounds or recent improvements (like the 0.998N^{1/4} upper bound), the problem itself is a research direction rather than a precise mathematical statement.
