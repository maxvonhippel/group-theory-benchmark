This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended, exploratory question asking "What can be said about the structure of A?" rather than stating a precise mathematical claim. The problem itself acknowledges that "even formulating a conjecture (even in the case c ≈ 1 and r = 1) seems hopeless." Without a specific structural property or theorem to prove, there is no well-defined statement to formalize in Lean.
