This problem cannot be formalized because it asks "What is the smallest subset of N containing..." which is a computational/optimization question rather than a theorem statement. While the comments mention a conjecture about the asymptotic behavior of Fk(N), the problem itself is asking for a construction or value determination, not asking to prove a specific mathematical claim. Open problems asking for optimal values or constructions cannot be expressed as Lean theorems.
