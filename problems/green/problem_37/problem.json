Writing Fk(N) for this quantity, it is conjectured that Fk(N) ≫k\nN 1−ck, with ck →0 as k →∞. One should not expect this problem to be easy,\nas it was shown by Ruzsa and me [146] to be equivalent to the so-called arith-\nmetic Kakeya conjecture of Katz and Tao (which implies the Kakeya conjecture in\nEuclidean space)."
