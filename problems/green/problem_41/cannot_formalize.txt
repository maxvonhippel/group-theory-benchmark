This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open research question asking "How many rotated copies are needed?" rather than stating a specific theorem. The problem asks for the minimum number of rotations of the pyjama set needed to cover R², which is an unknown quantity. While Manners proved finiteness exists, the exact bounds (especially lower bounds) are unknown - the problem even asks "is ε^{-C} rotations enough?" indicating the answer is not determined. Formalizing this would require stating a specific numerical claim, but the problem is exploring what that number is.
