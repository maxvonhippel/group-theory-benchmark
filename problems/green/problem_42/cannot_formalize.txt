This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is a meta-mathematical question asking whether a particular proof technique (the Cohn-Elkies scheme) can be used to establish a specific result (optimal circle packing bounds). The question "Can method X prove result Y?" is about proof methodology and the existence of a certain type of proof, rather than a precise mathematical statement that can be directly expressed as a theorem or conjecture in Lean. While one could formalize the existence of a radial function with the required properties, this would not capture the essence of the problem, which is an open research question about the capabilities of a specific proof framework.
