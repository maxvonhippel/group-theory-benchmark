  "problem_text": "Problem 43. Let N be a large integer. For each prime p with N^0.51 ⩽ p < 2N^0.51, pick some residue a(p) ∈ Z/pZ. Is it true that\n#{n ∈ [N] : n ≡ a(p) (mod p) for some p} ≫ N^{1−o(1)}?\nComments. This problem is formulated in [139, Section 4]. I think of it as a kind of ‘Kakeya problem in dimension 2 + ε’. One can make many other related conjectures. One of my favourites is raised in [9]: if A ⊂ Z/pZ is a set of size ⌊p/2⌋, does some dilate of A have no gaps of length more than p^0.49? To see the relation to problems of the type considered here, note that the complement of such a set would have to have a progression of length p^0.49, for each common difference d ∈ (Z/pZ)^∗.\nA minor variant of Problem 43 asks the same, but now with p allowed to vary in a range such as N^0.51 ⩽ p < N^0.52. Obtaining a lower bound N^{1−o(1)} here is certainly no harder than Problem 43, but I do not know how to do it. In fact, for this problem there may even be a lower bound of cN.\nOne can of course ask similar questions with 0.51 replaced by other exponents α.\nFor α < 1/2 these questions are straightforward by an inclusion exclusion or Cauchy-Schwarz argument, for much the same reason that it is relatively easy to establish the Kakeya conjecture in the plane. On the other hand I have observed (unpublished) that by arguments of Bourgain, progress for α ≈ 1 would imply the Kakeya conjecture.\nTo conclude these remarks, let me mention a toy problem related to the way in which pairs of residue classes a(p1) (mod p1) and a(p2) (mod p2) interact. It came up from a study of Problem 48, but seems to be concerned with the same phenomena that apparently make Problem 43 hard. Suppose that for all primes p with X ⩽ p < 2X one has a residue class a(p) (mod p). For distinct primes p1, p2 in this range, let f(p1, p2) ∈ Z/p1p2Z be the unique solution to f(p1, p2) ≡ a(pi) (mod pi), i = 1, 2. What can be said about the function a if |E_{X⩽p⩽2X} e( f(p1,p2) / (p1p2) )| ⩾ 0.99?\nPerhaps a() must be almost constant. More ambitiously, one could replace 0.99 by 0.01 or even smaller quantities."
