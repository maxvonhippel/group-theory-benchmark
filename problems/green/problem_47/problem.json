Questions of this type are known as the inverse large sieve problem. There are many questions here, but the following very particular instance is probably the simplest. Suppose that A ⊂ N is a set with the property that |A(mod p)| ⩽ 1/2(p + 1) for all sufficiently large p. The large sieve then implies that |A ∩ [X]| ≪ X1/2, and this is clearly sharp because one could take A to be the set of squares or the image of Z under some other quadratic map ϕ : Q → Q. However, is it true that either |A ∩ [X]| ≪ X1/2 / log100 X, or A is contained in the image of Z under a quadratic map ϕ : Q → Q? For background on this question see [144, 160, 280, 281]."
