This problem cannot be formalized because it is explicitly meta-mathematical. The problem asks "What is the structure of that set?" for extremal small sieve processes, and the author explicitly states "It is not at all clear to me what a good formulation of this question, the inverse small sieve problem, should be." The problem is asking researchers to formulate the right question, not to prove a specific theorem - making it unsuitable for Lean formalization.
