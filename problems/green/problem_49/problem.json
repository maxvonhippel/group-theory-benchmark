This is known as Marton’s conjecture or the ‘Polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa conjecture’ (PFR) (in finite fields). Many equivalent forms of it are known; see, for example [135] as well as [149, 197]. One of my favourites (due to Ruzsa) is as follows: if f : Fn\n2 → Fn\n2 is such that f(x) + f(y) − f(x + y) takes values in a set S of size K, is there some linear function f̃ : Fn\n2 → Fn\n2 such that f − f̃ takes values in a set S̃ of size O(KC)? Tao and I [271] gave an example showing that we need not have S̃ ⊂C S for any C, and Aaronson [3] analysed a different example of the same phenomenon due to Farah [109].\nThe best upper bounds for these problems, of shape exp(logC K), may be found in celebrated work of Sanders [249].\nUpdate 2023. This has been solved by Gowers, Manners, Tao and me [127].\nAn analogue of the conjecture may be formulated for subsets of Z, but this takes a little setting up and care is needed. The basic idea is that a large piece of A"
