This problem cannot be formalized because it asks an open-ended classification question: "Which finite groups have the smallest biggest product-free sets?" This is a meta-question asking to characterize or identify extremal examples, not a specific mathematical statement to prove. The problem comments explicitly note that the answer is unknown (whether the 11/14 exponent is sharp is open, and even for SL_2(F_p) the best known bounds are not tight), making it impossible to state a precise theorem capturing the problem's resolution.
