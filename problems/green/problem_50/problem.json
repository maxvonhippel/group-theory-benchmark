  "problem_text": "Problem 50. Suppose that A ⊂ F_2^n be a set of density α. Does 10A contain a coset of some subspace of dimension at least n − O(log(1/α))?\nComments. This is often known as the Polynomial Bogolyubov conjecture (over finite fields). It may well be true with 3A in place of 10A, but the latter would be fine for most applications. It implies the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, and seems to be strictly stronger than it; in particular, it is not addressed by the methods of [127]. Currently, the best bounds known are n − O(log^{4+o(1)}(1/α)) by work of Sanders [249]. One may also ask whether 2A contains 99% of some coset of a subspace of codimension n − O(log(1/α)), which would trivially imply that 4A contains such a subspace. In some ways I feel this is the most natural question in this circle of problems. Update 2024. Kościuszko [188, Theorem 9], building on unpublished work of Konyagin, has shown that for every η > 0 there is some m such that mA − mA contains a subspace of dimension at least n − O(log^{3+η}(1/α)).\nOne may ask related questions for subsets of [N], but these are presumably at least as hard.\nThe basic form of such a question would be whether, if A ⊂ [N] has density α, 2A − 2A contains a Bohr set of constant width and dimension O(log(1/α)).\nA consequence of this (equally unsolved) would be that 2A − 2A contains an arithmetic progression of size N^{c log(1/α)}.\nThere is also a natural question for subsets of (R/Z)^d: if A ⊂ (R/Z)^d is an open set of measure α, does 10A − 10A contains a closed subtorus of codimension O(log(1/α))? Qualitatively, results of this type are known [43]."
