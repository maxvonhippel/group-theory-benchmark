This problem asks "What is the largest size of coset guaranteed to be contained in 2A?" - this is a meta-question asking for the optimal value of a function f(α,n), not a statement that can be formalized as a theorem. The answer is currently unknown (with only asymptotic lower and upper bounds known that don't match), so we cannot formalize a precise conjecture about what the answer should be. Formalizing the known bounds would not capture the actual problem, which is to determine the tight bound.
