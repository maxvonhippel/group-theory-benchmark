This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research question asking whether an inverse theorem holds for a Gowers-type norm, phrased as "Does f correlate with...?" This is not a concrete mathematical statement but rather asking about the truth of a conjecture. Additionally, the specialized concepts involved (box norm/Gowers norms, multiplicative derivatives in additive combinatorics, and the specific notion of correlation used) are not available in Mathlib and would require substantial infrastructure to define properly.
