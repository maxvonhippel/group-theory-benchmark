This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended research question about the nature of quantitative bounds in the inverse theorem for Gowers norms, rather than a precise conjecture. The problem uses asymptotic notation (δ^{O_s(1)}) which describes a family of possible bounds rather than a single statement that can be proven true or false. Additionally, Gowers uniformity norms are not available in Mathlib, and the problem is fundamentally about comparing different types of bounds (polynomial vs. exponential) across multiple parameter regimes.
