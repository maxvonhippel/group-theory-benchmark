  "problem_text": "Problem 56. Bounds for the inverse theorem for Gowers norms.\nComments. This has been considered one of the biggest open question in the subject and it may be asked for finite fields and over the integers.\nOver finite fields, the question is simpler to state and it is natural to make the following ‘Polynomial Gowers Inverse Conjecture’. Fix an integer s ⩾ 1, and let p > s. Suppose that f : F^n_p → C is a function with |f(x)| ⩽ 1 for all x, and that ∥f∥_{U^{s+1}} ⩾ δ (the definition of the Gowers norm may be found in several places, including the works cited below). Then there is a form ψ of degree s such that |E_{x∈F^n_p} f(x)e(−2πiψ(x)/p)| ≫ δ^{O_s(1)}. Such a statement is not known for any s ⩾ 2. Indeed, it was shown independently by Tao and me [149] and by Lovett [197] that the case s = 2 of this assertion is equivalent to Marton’s Conjecture (Problem 49) for F^n_p. Update 2023. Polynomially effective bounds for the case s = 2 are now known as a consequence of the solution of Marton’s conjecture in [127, 128].\nFor s = 3, quantitative bounds (of double exponential type) were obtained by Gowers and Milićević [129], but for s ⩾ 4 only qualitative bounds are known, from remarkable work of Bergelson, Tao and Ziegler [27].\nIn the case s = 3, the problem is very closely related to the following attractive question. Suppose that f : F^n_p → Mat_n(F_p) is a map with image in the n × n matrices over F_p, and that rank(f(x + y) − f(x) − f(y)) ⩽ r for all x, y. Is there a linear map f̃ : F^n_p → Mat_n(F_p) with f − f̃ taking values in the matrices of rank at most 10r (say)? See [174, Question 1.5] for further discussion.\nThe assumption p > s can be removed, but care is required with the statement [148, 198] and significant further difficulties arise in the proof [246, 273].\nUpdate 2024. Until very recently, the situation for the ∥·∥_{U^{s+1}[N]}-norm over the integers was worse."
