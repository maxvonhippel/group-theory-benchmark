This problem cannot be properly formalized because it asks about the existence of polynomial bounds (expressed as δ^{O_s(1)}) in the inverse theorem for Gowers norms, where the notation O_s(1) is inherently asymptotic and not a precise mathematical statement. The problem is essentially asking whether the "Polynomial Gowers Inverse Conjecture" is true - an open conjecture about whether bounds of a certain qualitative form exist - rather than stating a concrete mathematical theorem or equation to be verified. Additionally, the problem discusses multiple related conjectures, partial results, and connections to other problems (like Marton's Conjecture), making it a survey of an open research area rather than a single formalizable statement.
