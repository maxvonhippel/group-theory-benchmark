This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is a research survey discussing open questions about quantitative bounds, rather than a single precise conjecture. The "Polynomial Gowers Inverse Conjecture" it mentions uses asymptotic notation (≫ δ^{O_s(1)}) which asks about the existence of polynomial bounds rather than stating a specific mathematical claim. Additionally, Gowers norms (U^{s+1} norms) are not available in Mathlib, and the problem discusses multiple interrelated questions (bounds for finite fields, bounds over integers, a matrix rank problem) without identifying a single statement to formalize.
