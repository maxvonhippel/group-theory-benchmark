  "problem_text": "Problem 59. Is every n ⩽ N the sum of two integers, all of whose prime factors are at most N^ε?\nComments. This was asked by Erdős, several times I think, but certainly in a collection [102] from 1981 one finds the following problem, which is essentially equivalent: ‘An old conjecture of mine states that if f(n) is the least integer not of the form a + b with P(a, b) ⩽ n then for every k and for n > n0(k) we have f(n) > n^k. This conjecture does not look hard but I could not get anywhere with it’.\nThe reason that the problem ‘does not look hard’ is perhaps that the set of integers less than N, all of whose prime factors are at most N^ε, has positive density (depending on ε). However, the problem seems closely related to other notorious binary problems such as the Goldbach conjecture. I believe the record is still Balog’s exponent 4/9√e ≈ 0.2695, obtained 30 years ago in [14].\nTrevor Wooley has pointed out the following, which he says is well-known. If p ≡ 3 (mod 4), and if p is the sum of two p^ε-smooth numbers, then there is some quadratic non-residue mod p of size at most p^ε. Thus, to answer the problem for all ε > 0 is at least as hard as the notorious Vinogradov least quadratic non-residue problem (at least, the version of that problem restricted to primes p ≡ 3 (mod 4)). The best unconditional exponent for that problem is 1/4√e, which is therefore a serious barrier for our problem. That said, the Vinogradov problem is known under GRH, so it may also be interesting to explore our problem with that assumption."
