Problem 56 cannot be formalized because it is not a precise mathematical conjecture but rather an open-ended research direction asking about what quantitative bounds exist for the inverse theorem of Gowers norms. The statement uses asymptotic notation (δ^{O_s(1)}) where the actual exponent is unknown and finding it is the problem itself. Additionally, the problem encompasses multiple related questions (finite fields vs integers, different values of s, a related matrix rank question) without specifying a single precise claim to formalize.
