The answer is probably yes. A proof of this may have to involve some computation (as well as, presumably, theoretical arguments) since the statement fails if a = 2 and b = 3 are replaced by, say, a = 9 and b = 10, since the size of the ‘words’ of a given length (for example, a(ab −1) −1 has length 3) grows much more quickly than the number of them."
