Cannot formalize Problem 67: The problem statement is truncated mid-sentence ("the least s such that all sufficiently large...") and incomplete. Additionally, the problem title "Bounds for Waring's problem over finite fields" describes a research topic rather than a specific mathematical conjecture or statement. Without the complete problem text specifying which particular bound or conjecture is being posed, there is no well-defined mathematical statement to formalize.
