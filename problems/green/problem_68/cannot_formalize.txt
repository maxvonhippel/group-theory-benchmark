The problem statement is incomplete - it is cut off mid-sentence: "the least s such that all sufficiently large" without specifying what property these "sufficiently large" objects must satisfy. Additionally, while the title mentions "Waring's problem over finite fields," the text discusses G(k) from the classical Waring's problem over integers, creating ambiguity about which setting is intended. Without the complete problem statement, it is impossible to formalize the precise mathematical question being asked.
