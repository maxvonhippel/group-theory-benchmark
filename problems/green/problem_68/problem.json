  "problem_text": "Problem 68. Suppose that A ⊂ F^2_p is a set meeting every line in at most 2 points. Is it true that all except o(p) points of A lie on a cubic curve?\n\nComments. There is an absolutely vast literature on ‘arcs’, which is the name given to sets with no-three in a line. However, I could not find this question asked, or really even hinted at, in that literature, which is more concerned with exact quantities for small p. I asked it myself in [137]. It is more natural to formulate the question in projective space.\n\nThe largest no-3-in-a-line set (arc) is a conic of size p + O(1), and Voloch [278], building on work of Segre, showed that any arc of size > 44/45 p lies in a conic. Below the threshold 1/2 p there are genuinely cubic examples. The would-be solver should also note that the result is false in F_q with q = p^2, where there exist ‘hermitian quadrics’.\n\nThere are many further problems on no-three-in-a-line sets, on which one would expect a positive solution to Problem 68 to shed some light. One of my favourites is the following. Denoting by f_d(p) the size of the largest no-three-in-a-line set in F^d_p, one has f_2(p) ∼ p and f_3(p) ∼ p^2. Is f_4(p) = o(p^3), or even O(p^{2+o(1)})? The point here is that in dimension 4 and above, low-dimensional algebraic examples are forced to contain whole lines. All that is known is a slight improvement f_4(p) ⩽ (1 − c)p^3 on the trivial bound, due to Nagy and Szőnyi [212].\n\nAnother problem is to determine the largest subset of F^2_p with no four on a line; at the moment there is a factor of 2 discrepancy between the lower bounds of (1 + o(1))p and the upper bound (2 + o(1))p."
