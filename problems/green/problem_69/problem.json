  "problem_text": "Problem 69. Fix a number k. Let A ⊂ R2 be a set of n points, with no more than k on any line. Suppose that, for at least δn2 pairs of points (x, y) ∈ A × A, the line xy contains a third point of A. Is there some cubic curve containing at least cn points of A, for some c = c(k, δ) > 0?\nComments. Very little is known, except when δ = 1 − O(1/n), in which case the statement follows from the main results of [150]. The statement is also known for sets A lying on curves of higher (but essentially constant) degree [92]; this could well be an important ingredient in any proof. Let us also note the following beautiful result of Barak, Dvir, Wigderson and Yehudayoff [17]: if a set A ⊂ C^d has ⩾ δn2 collinear triples and no k on a line, it has a subset of size ≫δ,k n of dimension ≪δ−2. I have often thought this should be relevant to Problem 69 but have not managed to establish a connection.\nElekes and Szabó [92] make the following conjecture, which is much weaker than Problem 69 (but should hold without the assumption of no more than k points on a line): if A has cn2 collinear triples, do some 10 points of A lie on a cubic curve? (Note that there is a cubic curve through any 9 points.)\nI was led to this question by consideration of the following two beautiful problems, both of which ought to follow from a positive solution to it or closely-related questions."
