Define Ulam’s sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 26, 28, 36, . . . as fol-\nlows: u1 = 1, u2 = 2, and un+1 is the smallest number expressible as a sum ui +uj,\ni < j ⩽n, in a unique way. Does this sequence have positive density? Can one\nexplain the curious Fourier properties of this sequence?\nComments. The first problem was asked by Ulam [276]. The second problem here\nrefers to the observations of Steinerberger [265], where data is presented to suggest\nthat there is a number α ≈2.5714474995 such that the sequence αun(mod 2π) has\nan interesting distribution function. Steinerberger’s paper may be consulted for\nmore information.\nA (somewhat) related class of sequence may be defined as follows. Start with\nsome ‘seed’ set of values u1 < · · · < um. For n ⩾m, define un+1 to be the smallest\ninteger greater than un not of the form ui + uj for i, j ⩽n. This construction\nwas considered by Dickson. A variant construction considered by Queneau is to\ndefine un+1 to be the smallest integer greater than un and not of the form ui + uj\nwith i < j ⩽n. For both variants, the following question appears to be open:\nis un+1 −un eventually periodic? For references and computations showing that\nperiodicity (if present) can be very slow to appear, see [111, 152]."
