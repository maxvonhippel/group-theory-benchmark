This problem cannot be formalized because it asks "What is the largest subset of [N]^d with no 5 points on a 2-plane?" - an open-ended research question seeking a value/bound rather than stating a theorem or conjecture to prove. The author explicitly notes uncertainty about the answer ("I do not know if there can be such a set of size N^{d-100}"), confirming this is an unsolved problem without a concrete mathematical statement to formalize.
