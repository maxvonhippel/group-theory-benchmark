  "problem_text": "Problem 72. What is the largest subset of the grid [N]2 with no three points in a line? In particular, for N sufficiently large is it impossible to have a set of size 2N with this property?\nComments. Specific cases of this problem date back to Dudeney over 100 years ago. Despite initial appearances, it has a very different flavour to, for example, Problem 68, as lines meeting the grid [N]2 often contain very few points. For a bibliography, see [152, Problem F4]. In particular, we note that there do exist such configurations of 2N points for N up to around 50. It was shown in [155] that for arbitrary N one can have ( 3\n2 + o(1))N such points, and my personal suspicion is that this is optimal. It is possible that any no-three-in-a-line subset of [N]2 is either small, or has a large subset which reduces (mod p) to a set of points on a curve in\nF2\np. It might be interesting to formulate a precise conjecture of this type and see\nwhether it can be used to show that the construction of [155] is optimal. I would\nfind this a lot more convincing than the heuristic given by Guy and Kelly [153].\nAn interesting related question is the following: is there a subset A ⊂Z2 with\nno three points on a line, and with |A∩[−N, N]2| ⩾cN for some absolute constant\nc > 0 and all sufficiently large N? The answer to this may well be no, as conjectured\nby Erde [94, Conjecture 5.1]. This seems plausible to me, due to the vague intuition\nthat examples of large no-three-in-a-line subsets of [−N, N]2 may have to come\nfrom constructions (mod p), with the value of p being somehow tied to N. On the\nother hand, Nagy, Nagy and Woodroofe [214] take the contrary view, and provide\nnumerical evidence based on greedy constructions that c may exist and be at least\naround 0.8."
