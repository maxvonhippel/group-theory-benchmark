This problem asks "What is the largest subset of [N]^d with no 5 points on a 2-plane?" which is an open-ended question seeking to determine an unknown extremal quantity, not a theorem to prove. The author explicitly states the answer is unknown ("I do not know if there can be such a set of size N^{d-100}"). Formalizing this as a mere existence statement (that a maximum exists) would be trivial and would not capture the actual mathematical content of the problem, which is to find or characterize that maximum value.
