This problem asks "What is the largest subset of [N]^d with no 5 points on a 2-plane?" - this is an open question asking for the value of an extremal function, not a mathematical statement that can be formalized as a theorem. The comments confirm it is open research ("I do not know if there can be such a set of size N^{d-100}"). While we could define the extremal function in Lean, the actual problem is to determine or characterize this function's value, which cannot be expressed as a provable statement without knowing the answer.
