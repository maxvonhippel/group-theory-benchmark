This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is a research question/conjecture asking "Is it true that...?" rather than a precise theorem statement. The problem involves probabilistic asymptotic behavior ("almost surely as n → ∞") for random walks on alternating groups, asking whether k random generators lead to O(n log n) mixing time. Additionally, the problem explicitly states "At present this seems a pretty hopeless problem," indicating it is an open conjecture rather than a known result to formalize.
