This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks whether there exists a "vaguely reasonable" bound for ε' in terms of ε in the arithmetic removal lemma, but "vaguely reasonable" is subjective and not mathematically precise. The problem does not propose a specific conjecture to formalize (e.g., "ε' ≤ f(ε) for some specific f"), but rather asks what good bounds might exist, which is a research direction rather than a formalizable statement.
