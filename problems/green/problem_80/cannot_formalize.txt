This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "find bounds" in the classification theorem for approximate groups, which is an open research problem requesting new mathematical content rather than a statement to verify. The problem explicitly notes the theorem is "ineffective due to the use of an ultraproduct argument" - the task is to discover explicit bounds that don't currently exist, making this a construction/discovery problem rather than a formalizable proposition.
