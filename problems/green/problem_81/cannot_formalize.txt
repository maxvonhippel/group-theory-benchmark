This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "find bounds" in an existing theorem, rather than stating a specific mathematical claim. The problem asks for the discovery of explicit numerical constants in the classification theorem for approximate groups (Breuillard-Green-Tao theorem), which currently only has non-constructive existence proofs via ultraproducts. This is a research directive to improve an existing result, not a precise statement that can be verified.
