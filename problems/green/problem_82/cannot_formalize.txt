This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research problem asking to "find bounds" in a theorem that currently has ineffective (non-constructive) bounds. The problem does not state a specific conjecture with concrete bounds to prove; rather, it asks for the discovery of such bounds. Since the bounds themselves are the unknown quantity being sought, there is no precise mathematical statement to formalize.
