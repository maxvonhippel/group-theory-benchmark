This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research question asking "how many traces are needed" rather than stating a theorem to prove. The trace reconstruction problem seeks to determine the optimal function m(n) such that m traces suffice to reconstruct a binary string of length n with probability 0.9 - this quantity is unknown and the subject of ongoing research. Only partial bounds (upper and lower) are known, and formalizing those would require specifying particular reconstruction algorithms and complex probabilistic machinery, which goes beyond a single problem statement.
