This is the ‘inverse Littlewood problem’; Littlewood conjectured, and McGehee-Pigno-Smith and Konyagin indepently proved, that ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ≫ log n. It is natural to conjecture that A has symmetric difference o(n) with a ± combination of O_K(1) characteristic functions of progressions. More precise conclusions should presumably be possible, but one has to be careful: for instance, if P is a 2-dimensional progression with sidelength ∼ e^{\\sqrt{log n}} then ‖\\widehat{1_S}‖_1 ≪ log n.\n\nA solution to this problem would be extremely relevant to Problem 1, as mentioned there, as well as to the further problems (1.1), (1.2) mentioned in the remarks to that problem. It may also be relevant (and it would be good to have a formal deduction of this type) to the currently unresolved Strong Littlewood Conjecture, which states that ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ⩾ (1+o(1))‖\\widehat{1_P}‖_1 = (4/π^2 + o(1)) log n, where P is a progression of length n. (In fact, I believe that the even stronger statement ‖\\widehat{1_A}‖_1 ⩾ ‖\\widehat{1_P}‖_1 is thought to hold.)\n\nThere are also interesting questions of this type in finite fields. For example, if A ⊂ F_2^n has ∑_r |\\widehat{1_A}(r)| ⩽ M then Sanders [250] showed 1_A is a ± sum of exp(M^{3+o(1)}) indicator functions of cosets. However, the true dependence may well be polynomial.\n\nLet us also mention the ‘Littlewood–Gowers problem’: if A ⊂ Z/pZ has density 1/2, what is the smallest possible value of ∑_r |\\widehat{1_A}(r)|? The example of an arithmetic progression shows that it can be ≪ log p, but the best known lower bound is ≫ (log p)^{1/2−ε}, due to Sanders [247]."
