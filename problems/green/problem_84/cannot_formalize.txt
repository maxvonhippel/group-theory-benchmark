This problem cannot be properly formalized because it asks an open-ended quantitative question: "How many traces are needed?" rather than stating a theorem to prove. The trace reconstruction problem is an active research area with a large gap between known upper bounds (e^{n^{1/5} log^C n}) and lower bounds (n^{3/2}/(log n)^{16}), and the problem is asking for the tight characterization of this function, which remains unknown. Formalizing any single partial result would not capture "the" problem statement.
