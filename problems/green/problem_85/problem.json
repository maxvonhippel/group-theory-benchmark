This is often known as ‘Carbery’s rectangle problem’, though it appears in a joint paper of Carbery, Christ and Wright. See [56, Section 6]. It is quite easy to show using Cauchy-Schwarz that there must be such a rectangle with area ≫ α2(log 1/α)−1. In the other direction, the example of a diagonal stripe of width ∼ α shows that one could not hope for better. A related discrete problem is"
