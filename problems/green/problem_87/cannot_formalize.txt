This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research question asking "how many traces are needed?" rather than stating a theorem to prove. The trace reconstruction problem asks for the optimal number of independent traces required to reconstruct a binary string with high probability, but this optimal value is currently unknown - only upper bounds (e^{n^{1/5} log^C n}) and lower bounds (n^{3/2}/(log n)^16) are established. Additionally, the problem is algorithm-dependent (the number of traces needed depends on the reconstruction procedure), making it impossible to formalize as a single precise mathematical statement without choosing a specific algorithmic framework and whether we're proving sufficiency or necessity of a particular bound.
