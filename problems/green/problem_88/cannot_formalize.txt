This problem (Problem 92 - trace reconstruction) cannot be formalized as a precise theorem statement because it is an open research question asking "how many traces are needed" for probabilistic reconstruction of a binary string. The problem seeks a quantitative bound (a function of n) rather than stating a theorem to prove. The various bounds mentioned (upper bounds like e^{Cn^{1/3}} and lower bounds like n^{3/2}(log n)^{-16}) are partial results toward answering this question, but the optimal answer remains unknown. Formalizing this would require either (1) choosing a specific bound to state/prove, which captures a partial result rather than "the problem" itself, or (2) stating the question meta-mathematically as "what is the optimal m(n)?", which is not a theorem.
