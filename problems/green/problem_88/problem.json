Consider a set S ⊂ [N]^3 with the property that any two distinct elements s, s′ of S are comparable, which means that s − s′ has either two (strictly) positive indices or two (strictly) negative ones. Is |S| ⩽ N^{2−δ} for some δ > 0?\n\nComments. This is perhaps the most basic of a host of questions considered by Gowers and Long [123], motivated by a question of Po-Shen Loh. It can be formulated as a question about the maximum independent set in a graph on vertex set [n]^3 in which two vertices x, y are joined if x, y are not comparable, which means that (x1, x2, x3) is joined to (for example) all (x1, x′2, x′3) with x′2 < x2 and x′3 > x3. One reason the problem is hard (it seems to me) is that it asks to go below the threshold for which a spectral bound (‘Delsarte’s method’) on the independence number might be possible.\n\nHere is a modular version which, while not as natural, has a similar flavour and more symmetry. Let S ⊂ F_p^3 be set consisting of all triples (0, y, z) where y, −z ∈ {1, . . . , 1/2(p − 1)}, together with the other five similar classes (e.g. (z, 0, y) satisfying the same property). Suppose that A − A is disjoint from S. Is |A| ⩽ p^{2−δ}?"
