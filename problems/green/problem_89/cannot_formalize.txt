This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking "Is there some V of moderately small codimension..." rather than stating a precise conjecture. The phrase "moderately small codimension" is inherently vague - the comments indicate the actual bound is unknown (somewhere between polynomial and exponential in 1/ε). To formalize this, one would need to choose a specific conjectured bound, but the problem explicitly leaves this as the open question being asked.
