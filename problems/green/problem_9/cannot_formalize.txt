This problem cannot be properly formalized because it consists of three open research questions ("Is X true?") about asymptotic bounds on Roth numbers r_k(N), rather than precise theorem statements. The questions ask whether certain conjectures hold (e.g., "Is r₃(N) ≪ N(log N)⁻¹⁰?"), which are meta-mathematical inquiries about the truth status of bounds, not statements to prove. Additionally, Mathlib lacks definitions for general k-term AP-free Roth numbers (only r₃ via rothNumberNat exists), and part (iii) requires Roth numbers over finite fields F₅ⁿ which are not formalized.
