In a remarkable breakthrough, Kelley and Meka [180]\nhave proved an upper bound of the shape r3(N) ≪ Ne−c(log N)β, and Bloom and\nSisask [32] have shown that one can take β = 1\n9. Note that a classical example\nof Behrend [25] from 1946 gives a lower bound r3(N) ≫ Ne−c(log N)1/2; in terms\nof the rough form of the bound this is still the best known, though in 2024 [91]\nElsholtz, Hunter, Proske and Sauermann gave a construction with a smaller value\nof c. Several commentators have remarked that the work of Kelley and Meka has\nessentially resolved the issue of how r3(N) behaves, but I respectfully disagree:\nto a certain extent the impact of their bound is enhanced by the numerology of\nthe problem, and over finite fields their methods still only give a bound r3(Fn\n3) ≪\n3ne−nc, which looks much further from the conjectured truth.\nIndeed, much stronger bounds of the form r3(Fn\n3) ≪ (3 − ε)n are known in\nthe finite field setting due the breakthough of Croot-Lev-Pach [78] and Ellenberg-\nGijswijt [93].\nRegarding (ii), the trick of Green and Tao [151] which worked for r4 is not avail-\nable for 5-term progressions, and nor are sufficiently good bounds on the requisite\ninverse theorem for the Gowers U 4-norm. Therefore this seems extremely difficult.\nUpdate 2024. Leng, Sah and Sawhney [192] have established a bound rk(N) ≪\nNe−(log log N)ck for all k ⨾ 5 which, while not as strong as (ii), is a significant\nadvance over the bound rk(N) ≪ N(log log N)−ck of Gowers, which had stood for\n25 years.\nFinally, (iii) evidently includes the Croot-Lev-Pach and Ellenberg-Gijswijt re-\nsults (over F5). However, is it possible to use their methods to prove such a result"
