This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking "under what conditions on K" a property holds, rather than stating a specific theorem to prove. The problem seeks to discover or characterize the necessary/sufficient conditions, which would require knowing the answer to the open problem first. A formalization would need a concrete statement like "A is almost invariant iff [condition]", but identifying that condition is precisely what the problem is asking researchers to find.
