This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open research question asking "How many traces are needed?" rather than a precise mathematical statement to prove. The trace reconstruction problem asks for the exact asymptotic growth rate of the number of traces m(n) needed to reconstruct a binary string with high probability - this is an unsolved problem with only partial upper and lower bounds known. Formalizing the known bounds (e.g., upper bound e^{O(n^{1/3})} or lower bound n^{3/2}/(log n)^{16}) would not capture the actual problem, which is asking researchers to determine what the true answer is.
