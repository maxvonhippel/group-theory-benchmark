This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open research question asking "how many traces are needed" for trace reconstruction, rather than a theorem to prove. The problem explicitly describes an unsolved problem with a significant gap between known upper bounds (e^{n^{1/5} log^C n}) and lower bounds (n^{3/2}(log n)^{-16}). Formalizing a precise statement would require choosing either to state the upper bound, lower bound, or the existence of some function - but none of these capture the actual problem, which is to determine the exact growth rate of the required number of traces.
