  "problem_text": "Problem 92. I have a string x ∈ {0, 1}^n. Let x̃ be the random string obtained by deleting bits from x independently at random with probability 1/2 (thus, for example, if n = 8 and x = 00110110, it might be the case that x̃ = 0111, generated by deleting bits 2, 3, 5, 8.) An instance of x̃ is called a ‘trace’. How many independent traces x̃1, . . . , x̃m are needed before one can reconstruct x with probability 0.9?\nComments. This problem is known as the trace reconstruction problem. I heard it from Yuval Peres in 2012, but it goes back to work of Levenshtein from the early 2000s. Independent work of Nazarov-Peres [213] and of De-O’Donnell-Servedio [80] on the topic gives the best known upper bound, showing that m = e^{C n^{1/3}} suffices.\nUpdate 2020. Chase [61] has improved this to e^{n^{1/5} log^C n}.\nSimple examples (see [21, §4.2]) show that m must grow at least linearly in n, and very recently Zachary Chase [60], improving on work of Holden and Lyons [162], improved this to m ⩾ n^{3/2}(log n)^{−16}.\nA related wide-open problem is that of reconstruction a binary string of length n from the multiset of all (n choose k) substrings of length k, the so-called k-deck. In [189], it is shown that k ⩾ C√n suffices (see also [254] for a different proof of a bound weaker by only a logarithm). In [83], it is shown that k ⩾ e^{c√log n} may not be enough (I thank Zachary Chase for these references)."
