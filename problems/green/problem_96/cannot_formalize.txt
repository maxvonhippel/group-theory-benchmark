This problem cannot be formalized because it involves specialized concepts from commutative harmonic analysis that are not available in Mathlib: (1) the harmonic analysis notion of "Sidon set" where the Fourier algebra A(Λ) = {(f̂(λ))_{λ∈Λ} : f ∈ L¹(T)} equals c₀(Λ), and (2) "sets of analyticity" where only analytic functions act on A(Λ). These concepts require substantial foundational infrastructure in abstract harmonic analysis, Banach algebra functional calculus, and the theory of function algebras on locally compact abelian groups that is not currently formalized in Lean/Mathlib. Additionally, the problem is an open question (the "Dichotomy Problem" from the 1960s) whose answer is still unknown.
