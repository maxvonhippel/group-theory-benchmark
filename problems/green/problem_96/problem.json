This problem, known as the Dichotomy Problem, was raised in the 1960s in the subject of commutative harmonic analysis. It is important to note that the notion of Sidon set here is not the one featured in Section 4, but rather the harmonic analysis notion: Λ is Sidon if and only if the Fourier algebra A(Λ) = {(\\hat f(λ))_{λ∈Λ} : f ∈ L^1(T)} coincides with c0(Λ), the algebra of sequences tending to zero. By contrast, Λ is a set of analyticity if only analytic functions F act on A(Λ). Much of the classical literature on these problems is difficult to penetrate for a modern reader (at least, it is for me). For more on the problem, I recommend, at least to the reader with passable French, the relatively recent paper of Kahane and Katznelson [170].\nIn that paper they show that a random set Λ in which P(n ∈ Λ) = p_n is almost surely Sidon if n p_n is bounded, and almost surely a set of analyticity if n p_n → ∞.\nA beautiful open question is whether every Sidon subset of Z (in the commutative harmonic analysis sense) is a finite union of independent sets, that is to say sets A ⊂ Z, all of whose finite subset sums are distinct (for example, the powers of two).\nIn celebrated work from the 1980s, Pisier [225] showed that S ⊂ Z is Sidon if and only if it has the following property (⋆): there is a δ > 0 such that, if S′ ⊂ S is finite, then S′ contains an independent set A with |A| ⩾ δ|S′|. The open question is then the completely combinatorial question of whether every set with property (⋆) is a finite union of independent sets. I should say that I am not sufficiently expert on these topics to say with any certainty what the relationship (if any) between this question and the dichotomy problem is.\nI included this problem here in memory of Jean Bourgain, who once told me he considered it a beautiful open question, and lamented that it might never be solved since to a large extent the subject had fallen out of fashion. Let me conclude these comments with another question of Bourgain, asked to Péter Varjú in 2013 [288]:\nIs it possible to find n points in the unit square such that the 1/n-neighborhood of any line contains no more than C of them for some absolute constant C? More information on this question may be found in [81]."
