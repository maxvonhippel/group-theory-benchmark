This problem cannot be formalized because it involves two highly specialized concepts from commutative harmonic analysis that are not in Mathlib: (1) Sidon sets in the harmonic analysis sense (where the Fourier algebra A(Λ) = {(f̂(λ))_{λ∈Λ} : f ∈ L¹(T)} equals c₀(Λ)), and (2) sets of analyticity (where only analytic functions act on the Fourier algebra). These require substantial foundational definitions about Fourier algebras as Banach algebras and the notion of "functions acting on" such algebras, none of which exist in Mathlib. Additionally, the problem is an open research question (the "Dichotomy Problem") rather than a well-defined mathematical statement to prove.
