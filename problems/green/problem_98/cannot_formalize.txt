This problem asks to "give bounds on ν(d)" which is an open-ended research request, not a theorem statement. The problem is asking for mathematical work to determine/improve bounds on ν(d), rather than stating a precise conjecture or theorem to formalize. While one could formalize the definition of ν(d) and known results like Birch's existence theorem or ν(3) ≤ 13, the actual problem statement is a research directive asking for new contributions, not a formalizable mathematical claim.
