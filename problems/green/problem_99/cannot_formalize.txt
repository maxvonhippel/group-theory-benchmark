This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks "what conditions on A ensure that..." which is asking to characterize or classify conditions, not asserting a specific conjecture. Additionally, the phrase "roughly α^n times" is intentionally vague and does not specify a precise asymptotic relationship, making it impossible to capture as a formal statement.
