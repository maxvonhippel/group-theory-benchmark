It is clear that S is product-free, and it is easily checked that the density of S in An is ∼ n−1/2. In the other direction, Eberhard [86] showed in a very nice paper that every subset of An of density > Cn−1/2(log n)7/2 does contain three elements x, y, z with xy = z. Thus the remaining challenge is to remove the log term. Moreover, Eberhard’s work gives very little information about the structure of the extremal sets. Update 2022.

Which finite groups have the smallest biggest product-free sets?\nComments. 20 years ago, Kedlaya [175] observed, refining some work of Babai and Sós, that it follows from the classification of finite simple groups that every finite group G of order n has a product-free subset of size ≫ n11/14. It may well be that this exponent is sharp. To show this, it follows by inspection of Kedlaya’s paper that one would need to show that the Ree groups 2G2(q), q = 32m+1, which have order ∼ q7, infinitely often have no product-free set of size ≫ q11/2. Certainly working with these groups in any direct way is likely to be very challenging, although the dimensions of their smallest representations are understood. A good model problem would be to determine the largest product-free subsets of SL2(Fp), since explicit computation in this group and with its representations are quite tractable. For this problem, I believe the best-known upper bound is O(n8/9), due to Gowers. For more on these problems, see Kedlaya’s more recent survey [176]."

Of course, one may also ask the question for longer progressions. A set S for which the conclusion of Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds, but with the common difference of the progressions restricted to lie in S, is called a set of (k − 1)-recurrence. Thus Problem 10 is asking for conditions under which a random set is a set of 2-recurrence.\n\nThe most optimistic conjecture here, suggested in [119] and [118, Problem 31] is that if n is chosen to lie in S with probability ω(n)/n, where ω(n) → ∞, then S is almost surely a set of r-recurrence for all r ⩾ 1.\n\nThe best that is known is the result of Briët and Gopi [47], improving on earlier work of Christ and of Frantzikinakis–Lesigne–Wierdl, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ (ω(n)/log n) · n^{−1/⌈k/2⌉} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely as n → ∞) with common differences in S.\n\nThe case k = 3 (Roth’s theorem with differences in S) is perhaps the most interesting in the first instance, and here the bound of Briët and Gopi is no stronger than the earlier results.\n\nA particular model problem would be to show that if P(n ∈ S) = n^{−0.51} then Roth’s theorem holds with common difference in S.\n\nUpdate 2023. Briët and Castro-Silva [46] have advanced the bounds for k odd, showing that if P(n ∈ S) ≫ n^{−2/k+o(1)} then Szemerédi’s theorem for progressions of length k holds (almost surely) with common differences in S. In particular, they resolve the model problem mentioned here.\n\nIt is a curious fact that, by the Bergelson–Leibman theorem, Roth’s theorem is known with common differences restricted to much sparser sets S, for example S = {13, 23, 33, 43, . . . }.\nHowever, the proof of that theorem seems to crucially exploit the fact that the derivatives of the sequence are eventually constant.\n\nThe conjecture in [118, 119] is motivated by the suggestion that the set of correlation functions of the form σ(d) := E_n 1_A(n)1_A(n + d)1_A(n + 2d) (where here we are taking k = 3 for simplicity) should have ‘low complexity’, since one expects σ(d) to be approximated in some sense by highly algebraic objects called nilsequences.\nHowever, recent examples of Briët-Labib [49] and Briët and me [48] show that the situation in that regard is more complicated than previously thought. Those examples do not, however, seem to impact on Problem 10 itself.\n\nFinally we remark that Altman [10] has also shown that in finite field models the random set S must be significantly larger for Roth’s theorem with common differences in S to hold."

Of course one may ask more general questions – for example, for reasonable bounds for the polynomial Szemerédi theorem of Bergelson and Leib-man in general. Peluse [217] has obtained the first quantitative bounds (of shape N(log log N)−c, c = c(p1, . . . , pk)) for configurations (x+p1(d), . . . , x+pk(d)) where the pi have distinct degrees.

Is W(k, r) a polynomial in r, for fixed k? Is W(3, r) ≪ r2?\nComments. I initially heard this question from Ron Graham, and I was certain that the answer should be no, for the following reason: Colour the points of a Behrend set in [n] of size ∼ ne−c√log n red, and the complement blue. One maybe expects this Behrend set to look in certain ways like a random set, in which case there should not be any blue progressions of length longer than ∼ ec√log n or so. However, this expectation is entirely wrong: the complement of any Behrend set in fact contains extremely long progressions, and I was not able to modify the construction (or any other construction) to get around this. I now believe that the answer to this question may be affirmative.\nFor numerical work on the problem, see [5]. Here, the exact value of W(3, r) is obtained for r ⩽ 19, and conjectured values are given for 20 ⩽ r ⩽ 30. It is observed that we do not have W(3, r) ⩽ r2, the first counterexample being r = 24.

This is a weaker version of the famous question asking whether x2 + y2 = z2 is partition-regular. (In that problem, z must also be the same colour.)\nUpdate 2023. This problem has now been resolved by Frantzikinakis, Klurman and Moreira [120]. The question of whether x2 + y2 = z2 is partition regular remains wide open."

This problem was apparently raised by Ganguly. I heard it from Robin Pemantle. It seems likely that the answer is ( 1/3 + o(1))n2, but this is not known. Aaronson’s paper [2] should be consulted for more information."

So far as I know, all that is known is the following: for k ≪ log log N, this is true, whilst for k ≫ N/ log N, it need not be. These results are contained in a 1989 paper of Erdős, Sárközy and Sós [107]. The truth of this statement even for constant k answered a question of Roth from at least 30 or so years earlier.\nRuzsa [241] constructs partitions A1 ∪· · · ∪Ak of an N-element set, k = N/m, for which the union |⋃_{i=1}^k (Ai ˆ+ Ai)| is as small as about Om(N^{1/2}). It ought to be possible to make these into partitions of [N] by a Freiman isomorphism/random covering argument. Ruzsa does not clarify the m-dependence in his article, though this should not be too hard to do if desired."

Both Andrew Granville (personal communication) and Swastik Kop-party (open problems session, Harvard 2017) asked me this question.\nUpdate 2023. Bedert [24] has made significant progress on this question, showing that the answer lies between ω(p) log p (for some function ω(p) tending to ∞ with p) and O(log2 p). This improves previous bounds of c log p and O(√p) respectively."

This attractive question was asked by Emmanuel Amlot on Stackexchange, and then subsequently attracted some attention on Math Overflow [286]. There are certainly many examples of such X and Y, for example X could be uniformly distributed on {n, 2n, 3n, · · · , (n − 1)n} and Y on {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}."

For the definition of K-approximate group, see for example [136]. Such a conclusion is known with |S| ≫K |A| (but not with a polynomial bound) by an argument of Sanders. See [44, Problem 6.5].\nShachar Lovett once mentioned to me the following vaguely related question: suppose that A ⊂ F2^n is a set of density 1/3. Is there a set B with 4B := B + B + B + B ⊂ A + A, and with 4B having density at least 1/100 in F2^n?"

To illustrate what is meant here, let me state a result of Eberhard, Manners and me [88, Section 6]: if |A − A| ⩽ (4 − ε)|A|, then there is a progression P of length ≫ε |A| on which A has density > 1/2. Then A′ := A ∩ P ‘obviously’ has D(A′) ⩽ 4. One can imagine a more general such result. One could also ask for bounds; in the proof of the result just stated for doubling close to 4, the constant in the ≫ε 1 is essentially ineffective."
