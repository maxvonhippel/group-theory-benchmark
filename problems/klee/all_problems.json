The chord is said to be normal (at p) provided the body lies on one side of the hyperplane which passes through p and is perpendicular to the chord; the chord is doubly normal provided it is normal at both p and q. It is known that if C is a convex body of constant width, then every normal chord of C is doubly normal, and in fact this property characterizes the convex bodies of constant width. But if 0 < a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < an and C is the ellipsoid in En determined by the inequality\n\n(x1/a1)^2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (xn/an)^2 \u2264 1,\n\nthen the n axes of C are the only doubly normal chords. These considerations lead naturally to the question above.\n\nWhen the bounding surface of the convex body is subjected to various regulatory conditions, existence of at least n doubly normal chords follows from the results of Marston Morse [2] or Lyusternik and Schnirelmann [1]. In the general case, it is easy to produce two doubly normal chords. First, if p and q are points of C whose distance is the maximum possible for such points, then the chord pq is easily seen to be doubly normal. Secondly, let H and J be a pair of parallel supporting hyperplanes of C whose distance apart is a minimum for such pairs, and let u and v be points of H \u2229 C and J \u2229 C respectively whose distance is a minimum for such points. Then the chord uv is doubly normal (and if uv = pq, then C is of constant width and admits infinitely many doubly normal chords)."

By a homeomorphism (of C onto C) is meant a continuous transformation T of C onto C, under which no two distinct points of C are carried onto the same point. Each point x of C gives rise to a sequence of points under successive iteration of the transformation T \u2013 x, T1x = Tx, T2x = T(T1x), . . . , Tnx = T(Tn\u22121x), . . . . If T is a homeomorphism, then so are all the transformations Tn, and thus the points Tnx and Tny must be distinct if x and y are distinct. On the other hand (by uniform continuity of Tn) there exists for each \u03f5 > 0 a \u03b4 > 0 such that the distance between Tnx and Tny is less than \u03f5 whenever that between x and y is less than \u03b4. In general, the number \u03b4 depends on n as well as on \u03f5.\n\nFor example, let C be the closed interval [0, 1], T0 = 0, and Tx = x1/2 for 0 < x \u2264 1. Then Tn0 = 0, while Tnx = x1/2n (for x > 0) and limn\u2192\u221e Tnx = 1. Thus no matter how close the point x may be to 0, there exists an n such that the distance between Tn0 and Tnx is at least 1/2. If this sort of behavior is exhibited for all pairs of points, the transformation is said to be expansive. Specifically, the homeomorphism T of C onto C is expansive provided there is a positive number d such that whenever x and y are distinct points of C, then for some n the distance between Tnx and Tny is at least d.\n\nIt is easily seen that if one convex body admits an expansive homeomorphism, then so do all others of the same dimension; thus attention may be restricted to spheres or simplexes. The following paragraph shows that a one-dimensional convex body cannot admit an expansive homeomorphism, but for n > 2 the problem is open. Expansive homeomorphisms were studied by Utz [3], who is responsible for the problem. An expansive homeomorphism of a (geometrically unpleasant) plane continuum was given by Williams [4]. For further information and references, see [1] and [2].\n\nNow consider a homeomorphism h of an interval [a, b] into itself. Clearly h must either interchange the endpoints a and b or leave them invariant; we suppose the latter, for the argument is similar in the other case. It is easy to establish the existence of an interval [p, q] contained in [a, b] such that hp = p, hq = q, and hx \u2264 x for all x in [p, q] or hx \u2265 x for all x in [p, q]; we suppose the latter, for treatment of the other case is similar. It now happens that hny \u2265 y for all y in [p, q], whence (for such y) |hny \u2212 hnq| < d whenever |y \u2212 q| < d. Hence h is not expansive.",

Sf(n, r)) of a convex polyhedron P such that every n-dimensional convex polyhedron having r + 1 maximal faces is affinely equivalent (resp. similar) to some proper section of P.\n\n(By proper section of P we mean the intersection of P with a flat which intersects the relative interior of P.)\n\nC. Davis [1] has observed that if a convex polyhedron has r + 1 maximal faces, then it is affinely equivalent to a proper section of an r-simplex. Consequently Af(n, r) \u2264 r. And Klee [2] has proved that \u03bea,f(n, r) \u2265 n(r + 1)/(n + 1), where \u03bea,f(n, r) (resp. \u03bes,f(n, r)) is the smallest possible dimension of a convex body Q (not necessarily polyhedral) such that every n-dimensional convex polyhedron having r + 1 maximal faces is affinely equivalent (resp. similar) to some proper section of Q. Thus\n\nn(r + 1)/(n + 1) \u2264 \u03bea,f(n, r) = Af(n, r) \u2264 r.\n\nFor r < 2n + 1, this implies that \u03bea,f(n, r) = Af(n, r) = r, but we do not know whether Af(2, 5) is equal to r or to 5, or whether Af(2, 5) = \u03bea,f(2, 5).\n\nFrom results of Naumann [4] and Klee [2] it follows that\n\nn(r + 2)/(n + 1) \u2264 \u03bes,f(n, r) \u2264 Sf(n, r) \u2264 2n(n + 1)(r + 1)\n\nbut the upper bound especially may be subject to much improvement. Melzak shows [3] that \u03bes,f(2, 2) = 3 and Klee [2] that Sf(2, 2) > 3, but the exact values of \u03bes,f(2, 3) and Sf(2, 2) are unknown.\n\nRather than considering the functions Af, Sf, \u03bea,f, and \u03bes,f defined above, it is perhaps more natural to consider functions Av, Sv, \u03bea,v, \u03bes,v, whose definitions are obtained from those above by replacing \u201cr + 1 maximal faces\u201d with \u201cr + 1 vertices\u201d. For these new functions we have (from [2]) the same lower bounds as those above, but are currently able to obtain upper bounds only by observing that if a polyhedron has r + 1 vertices then it certainly has fewer than 2r + 1 maximal faces (or by other observations almost this crude). It would be of interest to improve these crude upper bounds. Of course we have Av(2, r) = Af(2, r), etc., since a two-dimensional polyhedron has the same number of maximal faces as vertices. However, the values of Av(3, 4) and Sv(3, 3) are unknown.\n\nFor further related theorems, problems, and references, see [2].",
    "formalization_status": "cannot_formalize",
    "formalization_reason": "This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended determination problem asking to \"determine\" the values of dimension functions Af(n,r), Sf(n,r), etc. for all pairs of integers (n,r), rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The problem explicitly notes that several specific values (Af(2,5), Sf(2,2), Av(3,4), Sv(3,3), etc.) are unknown, making this an unsolved research problem about computing/characterizing these functions rather than a statement that can be formalized as a Lean theorem."

Asymptotes are studied in [2], where it is proved that if the closed convex set C (\u2282 E^n) admits no boundary ray, then \u03b1_C is empty or \u03b1_C = {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}.\nA similar situation occurs for a closed convex cone K in E^n. Of course K admits no (n \u2212 1)-asymptote, but it is known for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1 that all of K\u2019s projections are closed (and, in fact, K is polyhedral) if and only if all its k-projections are closed [1]; consequently \u03b1_K is empty or \u03b1_K = {1, . . . , n \u2212 2}.\n\nNow consider the following three closed convex subsets of E^3:\nU = {(x, y, z) : z \u2265 0, z^2 \u2265 x^2 + y^2}\nV = {(x, y, z) : x \u2265 0, xy \u2265 1}\nW = {(x, y, z) : x \u2265 0, xy \u2265 1, z \u2265 (x + y)^2}.\nIt is easy to verify that \u03b1_U = {1}, \u03b1_V = {1, 2}, and \u03b1_W = {2}. Thus for n \u2264 3 it is true that every subset of {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} can be realized as the set \u03b1_C for appropriately constructed n-dimensional closed convex sets C. We do not know whether this is true for large values of n. In particular, can the sets {1} and {1, 3} be realized as \u03b1_C for C \u2282 E^4? (It is easy to verify that certain sets of consecutive integers can always be realized in E^n \u2013 the sets {j, j + 1, . . . , n \u2212 2} for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 2 and {j, j + 1, . . . , n \u2212 1} for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1. For n = 4, these cover all the possibilities except the two mentioned.)",

    "formalization_reason": "This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended classification problem asking to \"determine what subsets of {1, ..., n-1} can be realized as \u03b1_C\" - a characterization question whose answer is unknown. The problem text explicitly states \"We do not know whether this is true for large values of n\" and poses open questions like whether {1} and {1,3} can be realized in E^4. Without knowing the complete answer, there is no single theorem statement to formalize; we can only formalize partial known results (like \"for n \u2264 3, every subset is realizable\"), but that would not capture the actual problem being posed."
