This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "determine" an unknown value (the greatest lower bound of Dπ/2/D0), rather than stating a theorem with a known answer to prove. The problem explicitly notes that the exact bound is unknown - Green's lower bound (√7-1)/3 ≈ 0.549 is not tight, and his conjectured bound of 1/2 was disproved by Sorgenfrey's counterexample, leaving the actual infimum as an open question. A Lean formalization requires a precise statement of what the bound equals, which this problem is asking us to discover rather than verify.
