This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended determination problem asking to "determine" the values of dimension functions Af(n,r), Sf(n,r), etc. for all pairs of integers (n,r), rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The problem explicitly notes that several specific values (Af(2,5), Sf(2,2), Av(3,4), Sv(3,3), etc.) are unknown, making this an unsolved research problem about computing/characterizing these functions rather than a statement that can be formalized as a Lean theorem.
