Sf(n, r)) of a convex polyhedron P such that every n-dimensional convex polyhedron having r + 1 maximal faces is affinely equivalent (resp. similar) to some proper section of P.\n\n(By proper section of P we mean the intersection of P with a flat which intersects the relative interior of P.)\n\nC. Davis [1] has observed that if a convex polyhedron has r + 1 maximal faces, then it is affinely equivalent to a proper section of an r-simplex. Consequently Af(n, r) \u2264 r. And Klee [2] has proved that \u03bea,f(n, r) \u2265 n(r + 1)/(n + 1), where \u03bea,f(n, r) (resp. \u03bes,f(n, r)) is the smallest possible dimension of a convex body Q (not necessarily polyhedral) such that every n-dimensional convex polyhedron having r + 1 maximal faces is affinely equivalent (resp. similar) to some proper section of Q. Thus\n\nn(r + 1)/(n + 1) \u2264 \u03bea,f(n, r) = Af(n, r) \u2264 r.\n\nFor r < 2n + 1, this implies that \u03bea,f(n, r) = Af(n, r) = r, but we do not know whether Af(2, 5) is equal to r or to 5, or whether Af(2, 5) = \u03bea,f(2, 5).\n\nFrom results of Naumann [4] and Klee [2] it follows that\n\nn(r + 2)/(n + 1) \u2264 \u03bes,f(n, r) \u2264 Sf(n, r) \u2264 2n(n + 1)(r + 1)\n\nbut the upper bound especially may be subject to much improvement. Melzak shows [3] that \u03bes,f(2, 2) = 3 and Klee [2] that Sf(2, 2) > 3, but the exact values of \u03bes,f(2, 3) and Sf(2, 2) are unknown.\n\nRather than considering the functions Af, Sf, \u03bea,f, and \u03bes,f defined above, it is perhaps more natural to consider functions Av, Sv, \u03bea,v, \u03bes,v, whose definitions are obtained from those above by replacing \u201cr + 1 maximal faces\u201d with \u201cr + 1 vertices\u201d. For these new functions we have (from [2]) the same lower bounds as those above, but are currently able to obtain upper bounds only by observing that if a polyhedron has r + 1 vertices then it certainly has fewer than 2r + 1 maximal faces (or by other observations almost this crude). It would be of interest to improve these crude upper bounds. Of course we have Av(2, r) = Af(2, r), etc., since a two-dimensional polyhedron has the same number of maximal faces as vertices. However, the values of Av(3, 4) and Sv(3, 3) are unknown.\n\nFor further related theorems, problems, and references, see [2].",
