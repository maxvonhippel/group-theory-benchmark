The chord is said to be normal (at p) provided the body lies on one side of the hyperplane which passes through p and is perpendicular to the chord; the chord is doubly normal provided it is normal at both p and q. It is known that if C is a convex body of constant width, then every normal chord of C is doubly normal, and in fact this property characterizes the convex bodies of constant width. But if 0 < a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < an and C is the ellipsoid in En determined by the inequality\n\n(x1/a1)^2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (xn/an)^2 \u2264 1,\n\nthen the n axes of C are the only doubly normal chords. These considerations lead naturally to the question above.\n\nWhen the bounding surface of the convex body is subjected to various regulatory conditions, existence of at least n doubly normal chords follows from the results of Marston Morse [2] or Lyusternik and Schnirelmann [1]. In the general case, it is easy to produce two doubly normal chords. First, if p and q are points of C whose distance is the maximum possible for such points, then the chord pq is easily seen to be doubly normal. Secondly, let H and J be a pair of parallel supporting hyperplanes of C whose distance apart is a minimum for such pairs, and let u and v be points of H \u2229 C and J \u2229 C respectively whose distance is a minimum for such points. Then the chord uv is doubly normal (and if uv = pq, then C is of constant width and admits infinitely many doubly normal chords).",
