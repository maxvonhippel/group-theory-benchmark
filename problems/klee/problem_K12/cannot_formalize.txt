This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended classification question asking "what numbers can be attained" as orders of various types of squared squares, rather than a specific mathematical statement. The problem asks to characterize sets of achievable orders and find minimum values, which are exploratory/construction tasks rather than theorem statements that can be formalized as propositions in Lean. A formalization would require either knowing the answers in advance (e.g., "the minimum order of a perfect squaring is 21") or stating existence/non-existence for specific values, but the problem as stated is asking us to discover these characterizations.
