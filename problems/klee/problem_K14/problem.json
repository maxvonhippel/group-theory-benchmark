And it is evident that Dn \u2265 n + 1.\n\nNow let d be a number greater than 1 and let Ln be the cubic lattice of side-length d in En \u2013 i.e., the set of all points of En whose coordinates are all integral multiples of d. Let Sn be the set of all points of En which lie at distance less than (d \u22121)/2 from some point of Ln. Then clearly the fundamental cube {x \u2208 En : 0 \u2264 xi \u2264 d} can be covered by \ufb01nitely many translates of Sn, and in fact these translations cover the entire space En. It follows that Dn is \ufb01nite, and the coverings described suggest modi\ufb01cation of the problem by placing additional restrictions on the sets of the covering \u2013 either on the individual sets (for example, topological conditions such as openness or closedness) or on their inter-relationship (for example, translation-equivalence or congruence).\n\nFor n = 2, the above problem was suggested to us by John Isbell, who attributes it to Edward Nelson.\n\n(The page continues with discussion/partial bounds and an example square-pattern construction labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H in an 8-square repeating arrangement, used to show D2 \u2264 8; and an argument showing D2 \u2265 4.)",
