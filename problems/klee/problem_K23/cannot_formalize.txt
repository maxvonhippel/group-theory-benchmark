This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended classification problem asking to "determine what subsets of {1, ..., n-1} can be realized as α_C" - a characterization question whose answer is unknown. The problem text explicitly states "We do not know whether this is true for large values of n" and poses open questions like whether {1} and {1,3} can be realized in E^4. Without knowing the complete answer, there is no single theorem statement to formalize; we can only formalize partial known results (like "for n ≤ 3, every subset is realizable"), but that would not capture the actual problem being posed.
