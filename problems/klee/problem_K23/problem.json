Asymptotes are studied in [2], where it is proved that if the closed convex set C (\u2282 E^n) admits no boundary ray, then \u03b1_C is empty or \u03b1_C = {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}.\nA similar situation occurs for a closed convex cone K in E^n. Of course K admits no (n \u2212 1)-asymptote, but it is known for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1 that all of K\u2019s projections are closed (and, in fact, K is polyhedral) if and only if all its k-projections are closed [1]; consequently \u03b1_K is empty or \u03b1_K = {1, . . . , n \u2212 2}.\n\nNow consider the following three closed convex subsets of E^3:\nU = {(x, y, z) : z \u2265 0, z^2 \u2265 x^2 + y^2}\nV = {(x, y, z) : x \u2265 0, xy \u2265 1}\nW = {(x, y, z) : x \u2265 0, xy \u2265 1, z \u2265 (x + y)^2}.\nIt is easy to verify that \u03b1_U = {1}, \u03b1_V = {1, 2}, and \u03b1_W = {2}. Thus for n \u2264 3 it is true that every subset of {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} can be realized as the set \u03b1_C for appropriately constructed n-dimensional closed convex sets C. We do not know whether this is true for large values of n. In particular, can the sets {1} and {1, 3} be realized as \u03b1_C for C \u2282 E^4? (It is easy to verify that certain sets of consecutive integers can always be realized in E^n \u2013 the sets {j, j + 1, . . . , n \u2212 2} for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 2 and {j, j + 1, . . . , n \u2212 1} for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1. For n = 4, these cover all the possibilities except the two mentioned.)",
