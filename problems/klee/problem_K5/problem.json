By convex polyhedron having at most k vertices we mean a convex body which is the convex hull of k or fewer points.\n\nIt is known that a neighboring family of plane convex bodies has at most four members, and that F(k, 2) = 4 for all k \u2265 3; on the other hand, E^3 contains an infinite neighboring family of convex polyhedra. The problem above asks what bounds can be placed on the size of a neighboring family when the polyhedra are limited as to number of vertices. Bagemihl [1] proposed the problem of determining F(4, 3) \u2013 that is, the maximum possible neighboring tetrahedra in E^3. He proved that 8 \u2264 F(4, 3) \u2264 17, and conjectured that F(4, 3) = 8. An elaboration of his argument shows that F(k, n) is always finite.\n\nAnother unsolved problem is to determine for various convex polyhedra P the maximum possible number of neighboring affine images of P.",
