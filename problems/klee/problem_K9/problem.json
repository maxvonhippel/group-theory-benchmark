By a homeomorphism (of C onto C) is meant a continuous transformation T of C onto C, under which no two distinct points of C are carried onto the same point. Each point x of C gives rise to a sequence of points under successive iteration of the transformation T \u2013 x, T1x = Tx, T2x = T(T1x), . . . , Tnx = T(Tn\u22121x), . . . . If T is a homeomorphism, then so are all the transformations Tn, and thus the points Tnx and Tny must be distinct if x and y are distinct. On the other hand (by uniform continuity of Tn) there exists for each \u03f5 > 0 a \u03b4 > 0 such that the distance between Tnx and Tny is less than \u03f5 whenever that between x and y is less than \u03b4. In general, the number \u03b4 depends on n as well as on \u03f5.\n\nFor example, let C be the closed interval [0, 1], T0 = 0, and Tx = x1/2 for 0 < x \u2264 1. Then Tn0 = 0, while Tnx = x1/2n (for x > 0) and limn\u2192\u221e Tnx = 1. Thus no matter how close the point x may be to 0, there exists an n such that the distance between Tn0 and Tnx is at least 1/2. If this sort of behavior is exhibited for all pairs of points, the transformation is said to be expansive. Specifically, the homeomorphism T of C onto C is expansive provided there is a positive number d such that whenever x and y are distinct points of C, then for some n the distance between Tnx and Tny is at least d.\n\nIt is easily seen that if one convex body admits an expansive homeomorphism, then so do all others of the same dimension; thus attention may be restricted to spheres or simplexes. The following paragraph shows that a one-dimensional convex body cannot admit an expansive homeomorphism, but for n > 2 the problem is open. Expansive homeomorphisms were studied by Utz [3], who is responsible for the problem. An expansive homeomorphism of a (geometrically unpleasant) plane continuum was given by Williams [4]. For further information and references, see [1] and [2].\n\nNow consider a homeomorphism h of an interval [a, b] into itself. Clearly h must either interchange the endpoints a and b or leave them invariant; we suppose the latter, for the argument is similar in the other case. It is easy to establish the existence of an interval [p, q] contained in [a, b] such that hp = p, hq = q, and hx \u2264 x for all x in [p, q] or hx \u2265 x for all x in [p, q]; we suppose the latter, for treatment of the other case is similar. It now happens that hny \u2265 y for all y in [p, q], whence (for such y) |hny \u2212 hnq| < d whenever |y \u2212 q| < d. Hence h is not expansive.",
