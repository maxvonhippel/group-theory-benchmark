Kourovka Problem 1.12 cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 because it is a meta-mathematical question about decidability/computability. The problem asks whether there exists an algorithm to decide if a finitely presented group with n generators and n relations (where n > 2) is isomorphic to the trivial group. This is an open question about the existence of a decision procedure, not a mathematical statement expressible as a theorem to be proven. Formalizing decidability questions requires encoding computability theory and Turing machines, and the "answer" would be proving decidability or undecidability - which is itself the open research question being posed.
