This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 because it is an open-ended classification question asking "for which groups" a property holds, rather than stating a specific conjecture to prove or disprove. Additionally, the concept of "first-order definability in the lattice of subgroups" requires formalizing arbitrary first-order formulas over lattice structures and their semantics, which is a meta-mathematical concept that would require building a substantial logical framework (syntax, semantics, satisfaction relations) that goes far beyond standard Mathlib. The problem is fundamentally asking for a characterization result, not a theorem statement.
