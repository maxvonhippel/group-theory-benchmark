This problem asks to "describe the universal theory of free groups" - an open-ended descriptive question asking for a characterization or axiomatization of all universal sentences true in free groups. This cannot be formalized as a Lean theorem because: (1) it is asking for a description/characterization, not a proof of a specific statement, (2) the problem remains open - while Makanin (1985) proved the theory is decidable, no explicit description of the universal theory is known, and (3) there is no single mathematical statement to formalize; it would require formalizing an unknown axiom system.
