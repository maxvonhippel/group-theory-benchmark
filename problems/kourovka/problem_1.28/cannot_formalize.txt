This problem asks to "describe" the universal theory of a free nilpotent group, which is an open-ended research question rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem requests a characterization or description of a logical theory, not a specific theorem to prove. Formalizing this would require not only encoding first-order logic syntax and semantics over groups in Lean, but also knowing what the "description" should be - the problem is asking for the answer itself, not asking to verify a given characterization.
