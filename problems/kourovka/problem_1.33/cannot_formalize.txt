This problem asks to "describe" the automorphism group of a free solvable group, which is an open-ended characterization request rather than a precise mathematical statement. Such "describe" or "classify" problems cannot be formalized as a single theorem because they ask for a structural description (e.g., "Aut(F_n^(k)) has the form...") rather than proving a specific property. The answer would require stating a complete characterization theorem, but the problem itself doesn't specify what form that description should take.
