This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking "What conditions ensure..." rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture. The problem asks researchers to find/classify sufficient conditions for a property to hold, which is a research direction rather than a precise mathematical statement. A proper formalization would require knowing the answer first (the specific conditions), at which point one could formalize "If [conditions] then the normalizer of a relatively convex subgroup is relatively convex."
