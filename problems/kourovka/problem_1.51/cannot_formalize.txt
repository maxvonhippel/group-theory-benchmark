This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking "what conditions ensure..." rather than stating a specific conjecture or theorem. The problem asks to identify or characterize the conditions that make a matrix group over the complex numbers orderable, which requires discovering the answer rather than proving a given statement. A formalization would require knowing the specific conditions to state as hypotheses, but the problem itself is asking what those conditions should be.
