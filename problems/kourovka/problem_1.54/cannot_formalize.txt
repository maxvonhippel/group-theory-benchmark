This problem asks to "describe all linear orderings" of free metabelian groups, which is an open-ended classification problem rather than a precise theorem statement. Formalizing such a problem would require already knowing the complete answer (the classification) and then stating that this classification is correct. Without the specific characterization being provided, there is no definite mathematical statement to formalize - the problem is asking for the description itself, not asking to verify a given description.
