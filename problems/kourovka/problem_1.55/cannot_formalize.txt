This problem asks for a "classification" of linearly ordered free groups with a fixed number of generators. This is an open-ended research problem requesting a description/enumeration of mathematical structures, not a theorem that can be stated as a single logical proposition. A formalization would require knowing the answer to the classification problem itself, which would then need to be expressed as something like "the set of all linear orders on F_n compatible with the group operation is in bijection with X" - but determining what X should be is precisely the mathematical content being requested.
