This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "find a complete system of invariants" for a quotient group. This is an open-ended classification/characterization problem requesting mathematical discovery, not a theorem statement that can be proven true or false. A formalization would require knowing the answer first (what the invariants are), which is precisely what the problem is asking to discover.
