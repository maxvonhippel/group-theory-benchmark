This problem asks to "Describe all minimal topological groups" - a classification/characterization request rather than a theorem to prove. While the definition of a minimal topological group (a non-discrete topological group whose closed subgroups are all discrete) can be formalized, the problem itself is open-ended and asks for an unknown answer rather than verification of a specific conjecture. There is no theorem statement to formalize; the "theorem" would be the classification itself, which is what the problem is asking to discover.
