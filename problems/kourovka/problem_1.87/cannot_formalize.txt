This problem asks "the same question" as 1.86 (whether identical relations have a finite basis) but for matrix groups over fields of characteristic 0. It requires formalizing: (1) group identities/laws (elements of a free group that evaluate to 1 under all substitutions), (2) the notion of a set of identities being "finitely based" (generated as a fully invariant subgroup by finitely many identities), and (3) the variety generated by matrix groups. Mathlib lacks the necessary universal algebra infrastructure for group identities and finitely based equational theories, making formalization impossible with current tools.
