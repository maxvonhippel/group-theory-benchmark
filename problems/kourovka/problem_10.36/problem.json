An affirmative answer is known for m = 0, n \u2a7e 3 (A. A. Suslin, Math. USSR Izvestiya, 11 (1977), 221\u2013238) and for m = 1, n \u2a7e 5 (M. S. Tulenbayev, Math. USSR Sbornik, 45 (1983), 139\u2013154; U. Rehmann, C. Soul\u00e9, in: Algebraic K-theory, Proc. Conf., Northwestern Univ., Evanston, Ill., 1976, (Lect.
