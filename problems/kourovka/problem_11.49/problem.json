  "problem_text": "11.49. B. Hartley (Proc. London Math. Soc., 35, no. 1 (1977), 55\u201375) constructed an example of a non-countable Artinian ZG-module where G is a metabelian group with the minimum condition for normal subgroups.\nIt follows that there exists a non-countable soluble group (of derived length 3) satisfying Min-n. The following question arises in connection with this result and with the study of some classes of soluble groups with the weak minimum condition for normal subgroups. Is an Artinian ZG-module countable if G is a soluble group of finite rank (in particular, a minimax group)?\nL. A. Kurdachenko"
