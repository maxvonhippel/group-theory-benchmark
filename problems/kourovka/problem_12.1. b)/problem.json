Bass (Topology, 4, no. 4 (1966), 391\u2013400) has constructed explicitly a proper subgroup of finite index in the group of units of the integer group ring of a finite cyclic group. Construct analogous subgroups for finite abelian non-cyclic groups.\nR. Zh. Aleev",
  "answer": "They are constructed: for p-groups, p \u0338= 2, in (K. Hoechsmann, J. Ritter, J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 68, no. 3 (1990), 325\u2013333); for the general case of groups of central units of integral group rings of arbitrary (not necessarily abelian) finite groups in (R. Zh. Aleev, Mat. Tr.
