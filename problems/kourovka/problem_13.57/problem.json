Nedorezov proved in (Algebra and Logic, 35, no. 6 (1996), 392\u2013397) that the group G is soluble for p = 2, and there are examples of unsoluble G for all p > 3.\nb) If G is soluble, is the derived length of G bounded in terms of p?\nc) (V. K. Kharchenko). If G is a p-group, is the derived length of G bounded in terms of p? (V. V. Bludov produced a simple example showing that the nilpotency class cannot be bounded.)\nE. I. Khukhro"
