  "problem_text": "13.59. One can show that any extension of shape Zd. S Ld(Z) is residually finite, unless possibly d = 3 or d = 5. Are there in fact any extensions of this shape that fail to be residually finite when d = 5? As shown in (P. R. Hewitt, Groups/St. Andrews\u201993 in Galway, Vol. 2 (London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., 212), Cambridge Univ. Press, 1995, 305\u2013313), there is an extension of Z3 by S L3(Z) that is not residually finite. Usually it is true that an extension of an arithmetic subgroup of a Chevalley group over a rational module is residually finite.\nIs it ever false, apart from the examples of shape Z3. S L3(Z)?\nP.
