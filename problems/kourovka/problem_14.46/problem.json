  "problem_text": "A finite group G is said to be almost simple if T \u2a7dG \u2a7dAut(T) for some nonabelian simple group T. By definition, a finite linear space consists of a set V of points, together with a collection of k-element subsets of V , called lines (k \u2a7e3), such that every pair of points is contained in exactly one line. Classify the finite linear spaces which admit a line-transitive almost simple subgroup G of automorphisms which acts transitively on points.\nA. Camina, P. Neumann and C. E. Praeger have solved this problem in the case where T is an alternating group. In (A. Camina, C. E. Praeger, Aequat. Math., 61 (2001), 221\u2013232) it is shown that a line-transitive group of automorphisms of a fi-nite linear space which is point-quasiprimitive (i. e. all of whose non-trivial normal subgroups are point-transitive) is almost simple or affine.\nRemarks of 2005: The cases of the following groups, but not almost simple groups with this socle, were dealt with: PSU(3, q) (W. Liu, Linear Algebra Appl., 374 (2003), 291\u2013305); PSL(2, q) (W. Liu, J. Combin. Theory (A), 103 (2003), 209\u2013222); Sz(q) (W. Liu, Discrete Math., 269 (2003), 181\u2013190); Ree(q) (W. Liu, Europ. J. Combin., 25 (2004), 311\u2013325); sporadic simple groups were done in (A. R. Camina, F. Spiezia, J. Combin. Des., 8 (2000), 353\u2013362). Remark of 2009: It was shown (N. Gill, Trans. Amer.\nMath.\nSoc., 368 (2016), 3017\u20133057) that for non-desarguesian projective planes a point-quasiprimitive group would be affine. Remark of 2013: The problem is solved for large-dimensional classical groups (A. Camina, N. Gill, A. E. Zalesski, Bull.\nBelg. Math. Soc. Simon Stevin, 15, no. 4 (2008), 705\u2013731). A. Camina, C.
