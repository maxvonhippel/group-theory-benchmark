A group \u0393 is said to have Property Pnai if, for any finite subset F of \u0393 \\ {1}, there exists an element y0 \u2208 \u0393 of infinite order such that, for each x \u2208 F, the canonical epimorphism from the free product \u27e8x\u27e9 \u2217 \u27e8y0\u27e9 onto the subgroup \u27e8x, y0\u27e9 of \u0393 generated by x and y0 is an isomorphism. For n \u2208 {2, 3, . . .}, does PSLn(Z) have Property Pnai? More generally, if \u0393 is a lattice in a connected real Lie group G which is simple and with centre reduced to {1}, does \u0393 have Property Pnai?\nAnswers are known to be \u201cyes\u201d if n = 2, and more generally if G has real rank 1 (M. Bekka, M. Cowling, P. de la Harpe, Publ. Math. IHES, 80 (1994), 117\u2013134).\nComments of 2018: Property Pnai has been established for relatively hyperbolic groups (G. Arzhantseva, A. Minasyan, J. Funct. Anal., 243, no. 1 (2007), 345\u2013351) and for groups acting on CAT(0) cube complexes with appropriate conditions (A. Kar, M. Sageev, Comment. Math. Helv., 91 (2016), 543\u2013561). Some progress has been made in the preprint (T. Poznansky, http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2486).\nP. de la Harpe"
