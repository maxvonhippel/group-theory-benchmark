Hall the number of conjugacy classes of P has the form n(p^2 \u2212 1) + p^e + a(p^2 \u2212 1)(p \u2212 1) for some integer a \u2a7e 0, which is called the abundance of P.\na) Is there a bound for the coclass of P which depends only on a? Note that a = 0 implies coclass 1 and that all known examples with a = 1 have coclass \u2a7d 3. (The group P has coclass r if |P| = p^{c+r} where c is the nilpotency class of P.)\nb) Is there an element s \u2208 P such that |C_P(s)| \u2a7d p^{f(a)} for some f(a) depending only on a? We already know that we can take f(0) = 2 and it seems that f(1) = 3. Note that A. Jaikin-Zapirain (J. Group Theory, 3, no. 3 (2000), 225\u2013231) has proved that |P| \u2a7d p^{f(p,a)} for some function f of p and a only.\nG. Fern\u00b4andez\u2013Alcober"
