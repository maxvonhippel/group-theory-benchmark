  "problem_text": "Is it true that large growth implies non-amenability? More precisely, consider a number \u03f5 > 0, an integer k \u2a7e 2, a group \u0393 generated by a set S of k elements, and the corresponding exponential growth rate \u03c9(\u0393, S) defined as in 14.7. For \u03f5 small enough, does the inequality \u03c9(\u0393, S) \u2a7e 2k \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03f5 imply that \u0393 is non-amenable?\nIf \u03c9(\u0393, S) = 2k \u2212 1, it is easy to show that \u0393 is free on S, and in particular non-amenable; see Section 2 in (R. I. Grigorchuk, P. de la Harpe, J. Dynam. Control Syst., 3, no. 1 (1997), 51\u201389).\nP. de la Harpe",
  "answer": "No, it does not. Counterexamples can be found even in the classes of abelian-by-nilpotent and metabelian-by-finite groups. (G. N. Arzhantseva, V. S. Guba, L. Guyot, J. Group Theory, 8 (2005), 389\u2013394)."
