  "problem_text": "a) Let G be a reductive group over an algebraically closed field K of arbitrary characteristic. Let X be an affine G-variety such that, for a fixed Borel subgroup B \u2a7d G, the coordinate algebra K[X] as a G-module is the union of an ascending chain of submodules each of whose factors is an induced module Ind^G_B V of some one-dimensional B-module V. (See S. Donkin, Rational representations of algebraic groups. Tensor products and filtration (Lect. Notes Math., 1140), Springer, Berlin, 1985).\nSuppose in addition that K[X] is a Cohen\u2013Macaulay ring, that is, a free module over the subalgebra generated by any homogeneous system of parameters. Is then the ring of invariants K[X]^G Cohen\u2013Macaulay?\nComment of 2005: This is proved in the case where X is a rational G-module (M. Hashimoto, Math. Z., 236 (2001), 605\u2013623).\nA. N. Zubkov"
