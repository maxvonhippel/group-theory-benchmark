  "problem_text": "15.63. a) Let Fn be the free group of finite rank n on the free generators x1, . . . , xn. An element u \u2208 Fn is called positive if u belongs to the semigroup generated by the xi. An element u \u2208 Fn is called potentially positive if \u03b1(u) is positive for some automorphism \u03b1 of Fn.\nIs the property of an element to be potentially positive algorithmically recognizable?\nComment of 2013: In (R. Goldstein, Contemp. Math., Amer. Math. Soc., 421 (2006), 157\u2013168) the problem was solved in the affirmative in the special case n = 2. A. G. Myasnikov, V. E. Shpilrain"
