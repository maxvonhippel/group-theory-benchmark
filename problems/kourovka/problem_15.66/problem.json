  "problem_text": "15.66. For a class X of groups let gX(n) be the number of groups of order n in the\nclass X (up to isomorphism). Many years ago I formulated the following problem: find\ngood upper bounds for the quotient gV(n)/gU(n), where V is a variety that is defined\nby its finite groups and U is a subvariety of V. (This quotient is not defined for all n\nbut only for those for which there are groups of order n in U.) Some progress has been\nmade by G. Venkataraman (Quart. J. Math. Oxford (2), 48, no. 189 (1997), 107\u2013125)\nwhen V is a variety generated by finite groups all of whose Sylow subgroups are\nabelian. Conjecture: if V is a locally finite variety of p-groups and U is a non-abelian\nsubvariety of V, then gV(pm)/gU(pm) < pO(m2).\nMoreover,\nthis seems a possible way to attack the Sims Conjecture that when we\nwrite the number of groups of order pm as p^{2/27 m3+\u03b5(m)} the error term \u03b5(m) is O(m2).\nP.
