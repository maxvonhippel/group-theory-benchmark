  "problem_text": "Among the finitely-presented groups that act arc-transitively on the (infinite) 3-valent tree with finite vertex-stabilizer are the two groups G3 = \u27e8h, a, P, Q | h^3, a^2, P^2, Q^2, [P, Q], [h, P], (hQ)^2, a^{-1}PaQ\u27e9 and G4 = \u27e8h, a, p, q, r | h^3, a^2, p^2, q^2, r^2, [p, q], [p, r], p(qr)^2, h^{-1}phq, h^{-1}qhpq, (hr)^2, [a, p], a^{-1}qar\u27e9, each of which contains the modular group G1 = \u27e8h, a | h^3, a^2\u27e9 \u223c= PSL2(Z) as a subgroup of finite index. The free product of G3 and G4 with subgroup G1 = \u27e8h, a\u27e9 amalgamated has a normal subgroup K of index 8 generated by A = h, B = aha, C = p, D = PpP, E = QpQ, and F = PQpPQ, with dihedral complement \u27e8a, P, Q\u27e9. The group K has presentation \u27e8A, B, C, D, E, F | A^3, B^3, C^2, D^2, E^2, F^2, (AC)^3, (AD)^3, (AE)^3, (AF)^3, (BC)^3, (BD)^3, (BE)^3, (BF)^3, (ABA^{-1}C)^2, (ABA^{-1}D)^2, (A^{-1}BAE)^2, (A^{-1}BAF)^2, (BAB^{-1}C)^2, (B^{-1}ABD)^2, (BAB^{-1}E)^2, (B^{-1}ABF)^2\u27e9. Does this group have a non-trivial finite quotient? M. Conder"
