Is it true that G acts freely on a Z^n-tree for some n?\nComment of 2013: It was proved that every finitely presented group acting freely on an A-tree acts freely on some R^n-tree for a suitable n, where R has the lexicographical order (O. Kharlampovich, A. Myasnikov, D. Serbin, Int. J. Algebra Comput., 23 (2013), 325\u2013345).\nA. G. Myasnikov, V. N. Remeslennikov, O. G. Kharlampovich"
