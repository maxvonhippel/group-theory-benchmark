  "problem_text": "b) Let G be a group generated by a finite set S, and let l(g) denote the word length function of g \u2208 G with respect to S. The group G is said to be contracting if there exist a faithful action of G on the set X\u2217 of finite words over a finite alphabet X and constants 0 < \u03bb < 1 and C > 0 such that for every g \u2208 G and x \u2208 X there exist h \u2208 G and y \u2208 X such that l(h) < \u03bbl(g) + C and g(xw) = yh(w) for all w \u2208 X\u2217. Do there exist non-amenable contracting groups?\nV. V. Nekrashevich"
