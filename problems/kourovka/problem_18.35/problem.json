Let G be a relatively free group of rank 2 in the variety of metabelian groups. Let T be a metabelian group in which the centralizer of every nontrivial element is abelian.\nIf T admits a separating family of surjective homomorphisms T \u2192 G must it also admit a discriminating family of surjective homomorphisms T \u2192 G?\nA positive answer would give a metabelian analogue of a classical theorem of B. Baumslag.\nA. Gaglione, D. Spellman"
