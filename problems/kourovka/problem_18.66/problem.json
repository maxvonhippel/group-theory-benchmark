  "problem_text": "Suppose that a finite group G admits a Frobenius group of automorphisms FH with kernel F and complement H such that GF is also a Frobenius group with kernel G and complement F. Is the derived length of G bounded in terms of |H| and the derived length of C_G(H)?\nN. Yu. Makarenko, E. I. Khukhro, P. Shumyatsky"
