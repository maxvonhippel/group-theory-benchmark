PROBLEM: Kourovka Notebook 19.110 (Bergman-Magidin)
===================================================

Do there exist varieties of groups in which the relatively free group of rank 2
is finite, and the relatively free group of rank 3 is infinite?

INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
======================

This is an open problem in the Kourovka Notebook, submitted by G.M. Bergman and
A. Magidin. The problem asks about a subtle threshold phenomenon in varieties
of groups.

FINDINGS:
---------

1. PROBLEM STATUS: Open. No solution found in:
   - The latest (21st) edition of the Kourovka Notebook
   - Published literature on varieties of groups
   - Work by Bergman and Magidin

2. WHY STANDARD EXAMPLES DON'T WORK:

   - BURNSIDE VARIETIES B_n (groups of exponent n):
     * For n = 2,3,4,5,6: All F_m(B_n) are finite
     * For large n (>= 665 odd): All F_m(B_n) with m >= 2 are infinite
     * No threshold at rank 3

   - CROSS VARIETIES (generated by finite groups):
     * All relatively free groups are finite
     * No threshold behavior possible

3. COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS:
   - GAP cannot construct arbitrary varieties or verify infiniteness of free groups
   - The problem requires theoretical methods, not computation

4. FORMALIZATION BARRIERS:
   - Mathlib lacks infrastructure for varieties of groups
   - Missing: verbal subgroups, relatively free groups, HSP theorem
   - Even stating the problem formally requires substantial development

CONCLUSION:
-----------

The problem cannot be formalized in Lean at this time because:

1. The underlying mathematical infrastructure (varieties of groups, relatively
   free groups) is not available in mathlib

2. The problem is fundamentally open - no approach to a solution is known

3. Neither computational methods (GAP) nor available proof assistants (Lean)
   provide tools adequate for this problem

The question touches on deep structural properties of varieties of groups and
remains an interesting open problem in universal algebra.
