  "problem_text": "Conjecture: Let G be a finite group, p a prime number, and P a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Suppose that an irreducible ordinary character \u03c7 of G has degree divisible by p. If the restriction \u03c7P of \u03c7 to P has a linear constituent, then \u03c7P has at least p different linear constituents.\nThis conjecture has been verified for symmetric, alternating, p-solvable, and sporadic simple groups.\nE.
