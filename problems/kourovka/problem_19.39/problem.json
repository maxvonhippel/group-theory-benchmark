  "problem_text": "A group is said to be X-critical if it does not belong to X but all its proper subgroups belong to X. Let F be a soluble hereditary formation of finite groups for which all F-critical groups are either groups of prime order or U-critical groups, where U is the formation of all supersoluble finite groups. Must F be a saturated formation?\nS. F. Kamornikov"
