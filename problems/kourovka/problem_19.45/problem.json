  "problem_text": "19.45. Let G be a group generated by 3 class transpositions (see the definition in 17.57), and let m be the least common multiple of the moduli of the residue classes interchanged by the generators of G. Assume that G does not setwisely stabilize any union of residue classes modulo m except for \u2205 and Z, and assume that the integers 0, 1, . . . , 42 all lie in the same orbit under the action of G on Z. Is the action of G on N \u222a {0} necessarily transitive?\n\nThe bound 42 cannot be replaced by a smaller number, since the finite group \u27e8\u03c40(2),1(2), \u03c40(3),2(3), \u03c40(7),6(7)\u27e9 acts transitively on the set {0, . . . , 41}, as well as on the set of residue classes modulo 42.\n\nS.
