Suppose\nthat a subgroup A \u2a7d G is such that A \u2229 H is a \u03c3i-Hall subgroup of A for every i \u2208 I\nand every \u03c3i-Hall subgroup H of G (see 19.84 in Archive). Is it true that then A is\n\u03c3-subnormal in G?\nAn affirmative answer is known if \u03c3 = {{2}, {3}, . . .} and if G is \u03c3-soluble.\nA. N. Skiba"
