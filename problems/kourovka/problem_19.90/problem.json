A skew brace is a set B equipped with two operations + and \u00b7 such that (B, +)\nis an additively written (but not necessarily abelian) group, (B, \u00b7) is a multiplicatively\nwritten group, and a \u00b7 (b + c) = ab \u2212 a + ac for any a, b, c \u2208 B.\nb) Is there a skew brace with non-soluble additive group but nilpotent multiplica-\ntive group?\nc) Is there a finite skew brace with soluble additive group but non-soluble multi-\nplicative group?\nA.
