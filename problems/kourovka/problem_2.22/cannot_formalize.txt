The problem references "the property RN" without defining what RN means. This term appears throughout the Kourovka Notebook (problems 1.69, 1.70, 2.22, 2.23, 2.71, 8.17) but is never explicitly defined in any available problem text. While "RN" likely refers to "residually nilpotent" based on common group theory conventions, the problem statement relies on an undefined external reference, making a precise formalization impossible without assuming the definition.
