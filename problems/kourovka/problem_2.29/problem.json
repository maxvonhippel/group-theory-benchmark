  "problem_text": "Does the class of finite groups in which every proper abelian subgroup is contained in a proper normal subgroup coincide with the class of finite groups in which every proper abelian subgroup is contained in a proper normal subgroup of prime index?\nP. G. Kontorovich, V. T. Nagrebetski\u02d8\u0131",
  "answer": "No. Let B be a finite group such that B = [B, B] \u0338= 1 and let r be the rank of B. Put A = \u2295_{p||B|} (Z/pZ)^{r+1} and G = A \u2240 B. We define a homomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 A by setting (bf)\u03c6 = \u2211_{x\u2208B} f(x), where b \u2208 B and f \u2208 F = Fun(B, A). Suppose that f^b = f for b \u2208 B and f \u2208 F. It is clear that f\u03c6 \u2208 nA, where n = |b|. In particular, C_F(b)\u03c6 \u2a7d pA \u2a7d O_{p\u2032}(A) if p | n. Every proper abelian subgroup H of G is contained in a proper normal subgroup. Indeed, we may assume that H \u0338\u2a7d F. We fix an element bf \u2208 H, where f \u2208 F, b \u2208 B, b \u0338= 1. Let p be a prime dividing |b|. For any h \u2208 H \u2229 F we have bfh = hbf = bhbf = bfh^b, whence h = h^b. Hence (H \u2229 F)\u03c6 \u2a7d C_F(b)\u03c6 \u2a7d O_{p\u2032}(A). If T is the full preimage of O_{p\u2032}(A) in G, then G/T \u223c= (Z/pZ)^{r+1} and therefore H/H \u2229 T is an elementary abelian p-group. The rank of it is \u2a7d r, since H/H \u2229 T embeds into B and H \u2229 F \u2a7d H \u2229 T. Thus, HT is a proper normal subgroup containing H. On the other hand, F is a proper abelian subgroup that is not contained in any proper normal subgroup of prime index, since G/F \u223c= B = [B, B]. (G. M. Bergman, I. M. Isaacs, Letter of June, 17, 1974.)"
