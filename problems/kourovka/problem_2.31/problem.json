  "problem_text": "Can every group admitting an ordering with only finitely many convex sub-groups be represented by matrices over a field?\nV. M. Kopytov",
  "answer": "No, not every. For example, the group G = \u27e8a_n, b_n (n \u2208 Z), c, d | [a_n, b_n] = c, a_n^d = a_{n+1}, b_n^d = b_{n+1}, [a_n, a_m] = [b_n, b_m] = [a_n, c] = [b_n, c] = 1 (n, m \u2208 Z)\u27e9 is soluble and orderable with finitely many convex subgroups, but it is not residually finite and hence is not linear over a field. (V. A. Churkin, 1969.)"
