  "answer": "A finitely generated matrix group over a field of characteristic zero has a subgroup of finite index which is residually a finite p-group for almost all primes p (M. I. Kargapolov, Algebra i Logika, 6, no. 5 (1967), 17\u201320 (Russian); Yu. I. Merzlyakov, Soviet Math. Dokl., 8 (1967), 1538\u20131541; V. P. Platonov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk Belarus. SSR, 12, no. 6 (1968), 492\u2013494 (Russian)). A finitely generated matrix group over a field of characteristic p > 0 has a subgroup of finite index which is residually a finite p-group (V. P.
