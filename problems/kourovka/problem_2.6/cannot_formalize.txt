This problem cannot be formalized because it uses specialized concepts from 1960s Soviet group theory that have no standard definitions in modern mathematical literature or Mathlib: "NR-groups" (groups where nil-elements coincide with the locally nilpotent radical), "generalized central elements," and "nil-kernel." These concepts would require substantial foundational development to define properly, and without precise, universally agreed-upon definitions available, any formalization would be speculative rather than accurate.
