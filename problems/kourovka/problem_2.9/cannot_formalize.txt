This problem cannot be formalized because it involves meta-mathematical concepts from universal algebra that are not expressible in current Lean/Mathlib: specifically, "regular associative operations on the class of groups" and "Mal'cev conditions" which require reasoning about proper classes of algebraic structures and properties of variety-theoretic operations. The problem asks for the existence of abstract categorical constructions with specific properties, which is a question about the landscape of possible algebraic theories rather than a concrete mathematical statement amenable to type-theoretic formalization.
