(a) If an abelian group can be written as a homomorphic image of a non-principal countable ultraproduct of not necessarily abelian groups Gi, must it be a homomorphic image of a nonprincipal countable ultraproduct of abelian groups? See (G. M. Bergman, Pacific J. Math., 274 (2015), 451\u2013495).\n\n(b) If an abelian group can be written as a homomorphic image of a direct product of an infinite family of not necessarily abelian finite groups, can it be written as a homomorphic image of a direct product of finite abelian groups?\n\nTo see that neither question is trivial, choose for each n > 0 a finite group Gn which is perfect but has elements which cannot be written as products of fewer than n commutators. Then both the direct product of the Gn and any nonprincipal ultra-product of those groups will have elements which are not products of commutators; hence its abelianization A will be nontrivial. There is no evident family of abelian groups from which to obtain A as an image of a nonprincipal ultraproduct, nor a family of finite abelian groups from which to obtain A as an image of a direct product.
