  "problem_text": "The free Burnside group of exponent four on three generators, B(3, 4), has order 269 as shown by Bayes, Kautsky, and Wamsley (1974). Their proof is based on a theorem of Sanov (1940) which shows that B(n, 4) is finite. Sanov\u2019s proof for B(3, 4) uses more than 232 fourth powers, because the subgroup of B(3, 4) generated by two of its generators and the square of the third has order 232. It is also known that B(3, 4) needs at least 105 relations to define it, as shown by Havas and Newman (1980).\na) Can B(3, 4) be defined with fewer than a million fourth powers?\nb) Can B(3, 4) be defined with fewer than a thousand fourth powers?\nc) What is the smallest number of fourth powers which define B(3, 4)?\nG. Havas, M. F. Newman"
