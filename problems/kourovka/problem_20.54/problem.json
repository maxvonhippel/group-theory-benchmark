  "problem_text": "A distance-regular graph of diameter 3 with the second eigenvalue \u03b81 = a3 is called a Shilla graph. For a Shilla graph \u0393 the number a = a3 divides k and we set b = b(\u0393) = k/a. Koolen and Park proved that there are 12 feasible intersection arrays of Shilla graphs with b = 3. At present it is proved that a Shilla graph with b = 3 has intersection array {12, 10, 3; 1, 3, 8} (Doro graph), {12, 10, 5; 1, 1, 8} (nonisotropic unitary graph for q = 4), or {15, 12, 6; 1, 2, 10}. The automorphisms of the last graph were found by A. Makhnev and N. Zyulyarkina (Doklady Maths., 84, no. 1 (2011), 510\u2013514). Does the graph with intersection array {15, 12, 6; 1, 2, 10} exist?\nA. A. Makhnev, D. O. Revin"
