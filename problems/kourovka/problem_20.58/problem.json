A finite group G is said to be recognizable (by spectrum) if every finite group H with \u03c9(H) = \u03c9(G) is isomorphic to G.\n\u2217a) Is it true that for every n there is a recognizable group that is the n-th direct power of a nonabelian simple group?\nb) Is it true that there is a nonabelian simple group L such that for every n there is a recognizable group whose socle is the k-th direct power of L for some k \u2a7e n?\nV.
