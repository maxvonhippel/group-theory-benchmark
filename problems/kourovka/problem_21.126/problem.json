Do there exist finitely presented subgroups of right-angled Artin groups whose Dehn functions are super-exponential, or sub-exponential but not polynomial?\nSuch subgroups are known to exist in general CAT(0) groups, whereas the only Dehn functions currently realized for subgroups of right-angled Artin groups are exponential and polynomial of arbitrary degree.\nI.
