  "problem_text": "For a finite group G, let \u03c71(G) denote the totality of the degrees of all irreducible complex characters of G with allowance for their multiplicities. Suppose that H is a finite group with \u03c71(H) = \u03c71(G). If G has trivial solvable radical, must H also have trivial solvable radical?\nA. V. Vasil\u2019ev"
