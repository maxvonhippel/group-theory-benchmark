  "problem_text": "Let Td,c denote the class of d-generated, torsion-free nilpotent groups having class c. It is known that Td,2-groups are self-similar for all d, that T2,3-groups are self-similar, and that there are T4,3-groups that are not self-similar (A. Berlatto, T. Santos, Preprint, 2025, https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16947). Are there T3,3-groups that are not self-similar?\nA. Dantas, S. Sidki"
