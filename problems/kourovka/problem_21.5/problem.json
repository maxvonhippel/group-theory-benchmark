Let G be a transitive subgroup of the group of finitary permutations FSym(\u2126) of a set \u2126, let N be a normal subgroup of G, and let S be a transitive Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n(a) Is it true that S \u2229 N is a Sylow p-subgroup of N?\n(b) Is it true that SN/N is a Sylow p-subgroup of G/N?\n(c) Are any two transitive Sylow p-subgroups of G locally conjugate in G?\nTwo subgroups X, Y of a group G are said to be locally conjugate if there is a locally inner automorphism \u03c6 of G such that X\u03c6 = Y. An automorphism \u03c6 of G is said to be locally inner if for every finite subset A \u2286 G there is an element g = g(A) \u2208 G such that a\u03c6 = g\u22121ag for all a \u2208 A.\nA. O. Asar"
