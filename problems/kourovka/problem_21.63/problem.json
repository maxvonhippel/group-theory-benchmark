Let F be a field of characteristic p > 0, and let \u0393 be the principal congruence subgroup of Aut(F[x1, . . . , xn]) consisting of all automorphisms that send each variable xi to xi modulo terms of higher degree. Then \u0393 is a residually-p group. Does \u0393 satisfy a pro-p identity?\nE. I. Khukhro"
