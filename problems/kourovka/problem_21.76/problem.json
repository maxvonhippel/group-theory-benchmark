The net \u03c3 is said to be completable if its diagonal can be supplemented with subgroups to a complete net. Completable elementary nets are closed. It is known that over fields of characteristic 0 and 2 there exist irreducible closed elementary nets that are not completable (V. A. Koibaev, Trudy Inst. Mat. Mekh. Ural Div. Ross. Akad. Nauk, 17, no. 4 (2011), 134\u2013141 (Russian); V. A. Koibaev, Siberian Math. J., 62, no. 2 (2021), 262\u2013266).\nDo there exist irreducible closed elementary nets of order n \u2a7e 3 over a field of odd characteristic that are not completable?\nV. A. Koibaev"
