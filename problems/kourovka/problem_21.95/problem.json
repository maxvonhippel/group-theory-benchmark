Is there an almost simple but not simple group which is recognizable by the isomorphism type of its Gruenberg\u2013Kegel graph?\nNote that if a group G is recognizable by the isomorphism type of its Gruenberg\u2013Kegel graph, then G is recognizable by its Gruenberg\u2013Kegel graph, and therefore G is almost simple (P. J. Cameron, N. V. Maslova, J. Algebra, 607 (2022), 186\u2013213).\nN. V. Maslova"
