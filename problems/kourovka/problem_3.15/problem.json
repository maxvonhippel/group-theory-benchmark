  "problem_text": "3.15. A group G is said to be U-embeddable in a class K of groups if, for any finite submodel M \u2282 G, there is a group A \u2208 K such that M is isomorphic to some submodel of A. Are the following groups U-embeddable in the class of finite groups:\na) every group with one defining relation?\nb) every group defined by one relation in the variety of soluble groups of a given derived length?\nM. I. Kargapolov",
  "answer": "No, in both cases (A. I. Budkin, V. A. Gorbunov, Algebra and Logic, 14 (1975), 73\u201384). Another example. The group G =\n\n\u27e8a, b | (b2)a = b3\u27e9\n\nis non-Hopfian as proved in (G. Baumslag, D. Solitar, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 68, no. 3 (1962), 199\u2013201) and therefore is not metabelian. We choose elements a, b, x1, x2, x3, x4 \u2208 G such that w = [[x1, x2], [x3, x4]] \u0338= 1, add to them 1, their inverses, and all the initial segments of the word w in the alphabet {xi}, and all the initial segments of the word a\u22121b2ab\u22123 and of each of the words xi in the alphabet of {a, b}. Let M be the resulting model. If M was embeddable into a finite group G0, then G0 would have to be metacyclic, and also would have to have elements satisfying [[x1, x2], [x3, x4]] \u0338= 1, which is impossible. Hence G is not U-embeddable into finite groups. Since the group G/G(k) is also non-Hopfian for a suitable k (ibid.), it is not U-embeddable into finite groups for similar reasons. (Yu. I. Merzlyakov, 1969.)"
