This problem asks to "describe" (i.e., classify/characterize) all topological groups with no proper closed subgroups. This is an open-ended classification problem where the answer itself is the mathematical content to be discovered. While the property "having no proper closed subgroups" can be expressed formally, the problem is asking for a complete characterization of such groups, which cannot be formalized without knowing what that characterization is. A formalization would require stating a specific theorem of the form "G has no proper closed subgroups iff [explicit condition]" but the problem is asking us to find what that condition should be.
