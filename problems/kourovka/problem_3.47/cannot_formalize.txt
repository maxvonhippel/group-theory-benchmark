This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "determine the laws of distribution" of certain types of numbers. It does not state a specific theorem or conjecture to prove, but rather asks for an investigation into patterns or characterizations. The phrase "laws of distribution" is too vague to express as a precise mathematical statement - it could refer to density, asymptotic behavior, arithmetic progressions, or other distributional properties.
