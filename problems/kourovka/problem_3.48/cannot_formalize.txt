This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question rather than a specific mathematical claim. The problem asks to "determine the laws of distribution" of non-soluble and simple group-theoretic numbers, which is an exploratory directive seeking to discover patterns rather than verify a specific theorem. There is no concrete conjecture or statement to formalize; the answer would require first discovering what the distribution laws are, then formalizing those discovered laws.
