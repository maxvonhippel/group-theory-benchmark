This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "determine the laws of distribution" of non-soluble and simple group-theoretic numbers, rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The phrase "laws of distribution" is inherently vague and could refer to asymptotic density, distribution functions, gaps between consecutive elements, or various other analytic or combinatorial properties. A proper formalization would require the problem to make a concrete mathematical claim (e.g., "the asymptotic density of non-soluble group-theoretic numbers is X" or "the set of simple group-theoretic numbers has property Y"), but this problem asks for an open-ended investigation without specifying what form the answer should take.
