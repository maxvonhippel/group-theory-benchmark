This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "determine" (i.e., discover and describe) the laws of distribution of certain number-theoretic properties, rather than stating a specific mathematical claim to be verified. It is analogous to asking "describe the distribution of primes" - there is no single theorem statement to formalize. A proper formalization would require the answer to the problem itself (the specific distributional law to be stated as a theorem), which is unknown and is precisely what the problem is asking to find.
