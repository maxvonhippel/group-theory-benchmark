This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "determine the laws of distribution" of certain number-theoretic properties, rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The phrase "laws of distribution" is inherently vague and could refer to asymptotic density, distribution functions, gaps between consecutive elements, or other properties. A formalizable problem would need to make a concrete claim (e.g., "the density of non-soluble group-theoretic numbers is X" or "there are infinitely many simple group-theoretic numbers"), but this problem asks for an investigation/characterization without specifying what form the answer should take.
