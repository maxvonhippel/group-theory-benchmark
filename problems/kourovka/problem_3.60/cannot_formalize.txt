Problem 3.60 asks to "investigate the relations between the p-length of a finite group and the invariants cp, dp, ep of its Sylow p-subgroup." This is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. It asks researchers to discover and characterize unknown relationships, not to prove a specific conjecture. Additionally, the invariants cp, dp, ep are not standard in Mathlib and their definitions would require consulting the referenced paper by Shemetkov.
