This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking "How to characterize the classes of finite groups of the form eV?" rather than stating a specific mathematical conjecture or theorem. The problem asks what conditions a class of finite groups must satisfy to be exactly the finite groups of some variety V, but does not propose any specific characterization to verify. Formalizing this would require stating "A class C is of form eV iff [conditions]" but the problem is asking what those conditions are.
