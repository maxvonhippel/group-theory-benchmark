This problem cannot be formalized because it consists of open-ended research questions. Part (a) asks "what is the best possible bound?" for the exponent of a Sylow 2-subgroup, without stating a conjectured answer. Part (d) asks to "find a small number of subgroups" satisfying certain properties, which is a construction problem rather than a verifiable statement. Both parts are seeking unknown answers rather than asserting specific mathematical claims that could be formalized as theorems.
