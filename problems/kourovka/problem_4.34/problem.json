Let v be a group word, and let Kv be the class of groups G such that there exists a positive integer n = n(G) such that each element of the verbal subgroup vG can be represented as a product of n values of the word v on the group G.\na) For which v do all finitely generated soluble groups belong to the class Kv?\nb) Does the word v(x, y) = x\u22121y\u22121xy satisfy this condition?\nM.
