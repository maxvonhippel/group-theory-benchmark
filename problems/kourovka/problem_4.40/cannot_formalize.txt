This problem asks "for what natural numbers n" a certain matrix group decomposition GL_n(ℝ) = D_n(ℝ) · O_n(ℝ) · UT_n(ℝ) · GL_n(ℤ) holds, which is an open-ended characterization question rather than a single mathematical statement to prove. The problem remains partially open: it is known to hold for n ≤ 3 and to fail for sufficiently large n, but the complete characterization (especially for n ≥ 6 related to Minkowski's problem) remains unresolved. Formalizing this would require stating the complete answer, which is unknown.
