  "problem_text": "4.46. a) We call a variety of groups a limit variety if it cannot be defined by finitely many laws, while each of its proper subvarieties has a finite basis of identities. It follows from Zorn\u2019s lemma that every variety that has no finite basis of identities contains a limit subvariety. Give explicitly (by means of identities or by a generating group) at least one limit variety.\nA. Yu. Olshanskii"
