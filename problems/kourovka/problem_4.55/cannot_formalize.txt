This problem cannot be properly formalized because:

1. Part (a) asks to "describe G(T)" and "what does it mean [U] = [V] in G(T)" - these are open-ended questions asking for characterizations or structure theorems, not precise mathematical statements that can be formalized as theorems.

2. Part (b) states a conjecture, but formalizing it requires first constructing the category T (modules with specific localization properties at maximal ideals) and its Grothendieck group G(T), which involves sophisticated module-theoretic constructions (localization of modules over algebras, Grothendieck groups of exact categories) that are not directly available in current Mathlib and would require substantial foundational development.

3. The problem is fundamentally asking for mathematical insight/description rather than stating a precise claim to be verified.
