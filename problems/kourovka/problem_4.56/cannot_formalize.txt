This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 for multiple reasons:

1. Part a) asks to "Describe G(T)" and "what does it mean [U] = [V] in G(T)?" - these are open-ended descriptive questions asking for a characterization, not precise theorems that can be stated formally.

2. The Grothendieck group G(T) is defined as the K-theoretic Grothendieck group of a category relative to short exact sequences. Mathlib's Algebra.GrothendieckGroup is only the group-theoretic construction for monoids, not the categorical K-theory construction needed here.

3. The category T itself is defined via conditions involving localizations at all maximal ideals simultaneously, which would require substantial custom infrastructure to formalize properly.
