This problem cannot be formalized because:

1. Part a) asks to "describe G(T)" and explain "what does it mean: [U] = [V] in G(T)?" - these are open-ended questions requesting characterizations/explanations rather than precise theorem statements that can be formalized.

2. Part b) is a conjecture involving the Grothendieck group of a category relative to short exact sequences, which requires specialized categorical machinery (K-theory) not currently available in Mathlib. The category T itself involves module localization at all maximal ideals simultaneously with specific isomorphism conditions.

3. Even the conjecture's statement "Ker φ = Ker ψ" (equality, not isomorphism) is unusual and likely requires additional context about how kernels are identified in this setting.
