This problem cannot be properly formalized because: (1) Part a) asks to "describe" the Grothendieck group G(T) and explain what equality means in it - this is an open-ended research question seeking characterization/insight rather than a concrete theorem statement; (2) The class T is defined via localization conditions (Pm isomorphic to free modules at each maximal ideal m) and Grothendieck groups of specific module subcategories, which are not readily available in Mathlib in the composable form needed; (3) Part b) is a conjecture whose statement depends on understanding [U]=[V] in G(T) from part a), making it incomplete without first answering the descriptive question.
