  "problem_text": "Let E = H \u2217 K and denote the augmentation ideals of the groups E, H, K by e, h, k, respectively. If I is a right ideal in ZE, let dE(I) denote the minimum number of generators of I as a right ideal. Assuming H and K finitely generated, is it true that dE(e) = dE(hE) + dE(kE)? Here hE is, of course, the right ideal generated by h; similarly for kE.\nK. W. Gruenberg",
  "answer": "Not always (P. A. Linnell, unpublished). A simple example: H is elementary abelian group of order 4, K is elementary abelian of order 9.\nHere dE(e) = 3, although dE(hE) = dE(kE) = 2. (K. W. Gruenberg, Letter of July, 27, 1995.)"
