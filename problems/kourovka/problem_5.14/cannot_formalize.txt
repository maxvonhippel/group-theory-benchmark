This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 because all four parts (a, b, c, d) are open-ended classification questions asking to "Describe" finite groups satisfying certain properties. These are not precise theorems with definite statements to prove, but rather requests for characterization/classification results. A formalization would require knowing the answer (the classification) in advance, which is the content of the problem itself.
