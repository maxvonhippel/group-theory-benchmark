This problem is an open question from the Kourovka Notebook, not a theorem to prove. It asks whether every finitely generated abelian-by-polycyclic-by-finite group G can be embedded into the automorphism group of some finitely generated metabelian group M. Since this is an unsolved research question (the answer is unknown), it cannot be formalized as a Lean theorem statement with a sorry proof - we don't know if the statement is true or false.
