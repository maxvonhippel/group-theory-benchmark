Kourovka Notebook Problem 5.54 (J. Wiegold)
===========================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
Let p, q, r be distinct primes and u(x, y, z) a commutator word in three variables.
Prove that there exist (infinitely many?) natural numbers n such that the alternating
group A_n can be generated by three elements xi, eta, zeta satisfying:
  xi^p = eta^q = zeta^r = xi*eta*zeta * u(xi, eta, zeta) = 1

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
---------------------

1. CONNECTION TO TRIANGLE GROUPS

The simplest case u = 1 (trivial commutator word) gives the classical triangle group
presentation:
  Delta(p,q,r) = <x, y, z | x^p = y^q = z^r = xyz = 1>

When 1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1, this is a hyperbolic triangle group (infinite).
Finite simple groups that are quotients of Delta(p,q,r) are said to have a
(p,q,r)-generation.

2. KNOWN RESULTS FOR ALTERNATING GROUPS

- A_5 has (2,3,5)-generation: A_5 is isomorphic to PSL(2,5) and is the icosahedral
  group, a quotient of the (2,3,5) triangle group.

- Miller (1901): All alternating groups except A_6, A_7, A_8 can be generated by
  elements of orders 2 and 3.

- Hurwitz groups (quotients of the (2,3,7) triangle group): The smallest alternating
  group that is a Hurwitz group is A_15. Many larger A_n are also Hurwitz groups.

- All 26 sporadic simple groups are quotients of some triangle group.

3. GAP COMPUTATIONS PERFORMED

Using GAP, I verified:

- A_5 (order 60): Has (2,3,5)-generation with xyz = 1. Found 120 valid generating triples.
- A_5: With u = [[x,y],z], found 240 valid generating triples satisfying xyz*u = 1.
- A_5: With u = [x,y], found 0 valid generating triples (no solutions).
- A_6 (order 360): No (2,3,5)-generation with xyz = 1 found.
- A_7 (order 2520): No (2,3,5)-generation with xyz = 1 found.
- A_7: No (2,3,7)-generation with xyz = 1 found.
- A_8 (order 20160): No (2,3,5)-generation with xyz = 1 found.

The (2,3,5) triangle group presentation <x,y,z | x^2=y^3=z^5=xyz=1> gives exactly
A_5 (verified: group of order 60, ID [60,5] = A_5 in GAP's SmallGroups library).

4. ELEMENT ORDERS IN ALTERNATING GROUPS

- A_5: orders {1, 2, 3, 5}
- A_7: orders {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- A_10: orders {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 21}

For (p,q,r)-generation to be possible, A_n must contain elements of orders p, q, r.

DIFFICULTY OF FORMALIZATION
---------------------------

1. DEFINING COMMUTATOR WORDS

A commutator word is an element of the free group F(x,y,z) that lies in its derived
subgroup [F,F]. Examples:
- [x,y] = x^(-1)y^(-1)xy
- [[x,y],z]
- [x,[y,z]]
- [x,y][y,z]^(-1)

Formalizing "commutator word" requires:
- Defining free groups over arbitrary sets
- Defining the derived subgroup construction
- Characterizing elements that evaluate to 1 in every abelian group

2. THE UNIVERSAL QUANTIFICATION

The problem asks to prove existence FOR ALL choices of:
- Distinct primes p, q, r
- Commutator words u(x,y,z)

This requires understanding the structure of all commutator words, which is a rich
area involving combinatorial group theory.

3. THE EXISTENTIAL CLAIM

Proving that SOME n exists (let alone infinitely many) requires:
- Understanding which finite groups are quotients of groups with given presentations
- The theory of triangle group quotients
- Possibly classification of finite simple groups

4. MISSING INFRASTRUCTURE IN MATHLIB

As of early 2025, Mathlib has:
- Basic group theory (Subgroup, QuotientGroup, etc.)
- Symmetric and alternating groups (Equiv.Perm)
- Some results on simple groups

But lacks:
- A developed theory of free groups on infinite sets with relations
- Triangle groups and their quotients
- (p,q,r)-generation theory for finite simple groups
- Comprehensive results on commutator words

WHY FORMALIZATION WAS NOT ACHIEVED
----------------------------------

1. OPEN PROBLEM: This appears to be an unsolved problem in the Kourovka Notebook.
   The question mark in "infinitely many?" indicates uncertainty even in the
   problem statement.

2. DEEP MATHEMATICS: A proof would likely require:
   - Classification of finite simple groups
   - Structure theory of hyperbolic triangle group quotients
   - Asymptotic counting arguments for (p,q,r)-generations

3. INFRASTRUCTURE GAP: The mathematical concepts needed (free groups with relations,
   commutator word evaluation, triangle group quotients) are not developed in Mathlib.

4. NO KNOWN COUNTEREXAMPLE: GAP computations did not find a counterexample, and
   based on known results about alternating groups as triangle group quotients,
   the conjecture is likely true (at least for existence, if not infinitude).

PARTIAL INSIGHTS
----------------

The GAP experiments suggest:
1. For fixed primes p,q,r, not all A_n have (p,q,r)-generation
2. The commutator word u affects which n work
3. The answer likely varies with the specific commutator word chosen

For the trivial case u=1, this reduces to the well-studied question of which
simple groups are (p,q,r)-generated (quotients of triangle groups).

CONCLUSION
----------
This problem cannot currently be formalized in Lean because:
1. It is an open problem requiring original mathematical research
2. The necessary infrastructure (free groups, commutator words, triangle groups)
   is not available in Mathlib
3. The universal quantification over all commutator words makes even stating
   the problem precisely require significant development

The appropriate outcome is COULD_NOT_FORMALIZE.
