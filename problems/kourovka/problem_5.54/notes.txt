PROBLEM: Kourovka Notebook 5.54 (J. Wiegold)
============================================

Let p, q, r be distinct primes and u(x, y, z) a commutator word in three variables.
Prove that there exist (infinitely many?) natural numbers n such that the alternating
group A_n can be generated by three elements xi, eta, zeta satisfying:
  xi^p = eta^q = zeta^r = xi*eta*zeta * u(xi, eta, zeta) = 1

SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION
========================

1. LITERATURE SEARCH
   - Searched Kourovka Notebook archives (editions 18, 20)
   - Searched for papers on (p,q,r)-generation of alternating groups
   - Found extensive literature on triangle groups and their finite quotients
   - Did not find a published solution to this specific problem

2. MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT
   - The case u=1 reduces to classical triangle group presentations
   - Triangle groups Delta(p,q,r) = <x,y,z | x^p=y^q=z^r=xyz=1>
   - Hyperbolic when 1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1
   - Many finite simple groups, including alternating groups, are quotients

3. GAP COMPUTATIONS
   Tested various alternating groups with different prime triples:

   A_5 (order 60):
   - (2,3,5)-generation with xyz=1: EXISTS (120 triples found)
   - With u=[[x,y],z]: EXISTS (240 triples found)
   - With u=[x,y]: DOES NOT EXIST (0 triples)

   A_6 (order 360):
   - (2,3,5)-generation with xyz=1: DOES NOT EXIST

   A_7 (order 2520):
   - (2,3,5)-generation with xyz=1: DOES NOT EXIST
   - (2,3,7)-generation with xyz=1: DOES NOT EXIST

   A_8 (order 20160):
   - (2,3,5)-generation with xyz=1: DOES NOT EXIST

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS
   - The (2,3,5) triangle group has A_5 as its unique finite quotient
   - Not all A_n have (p,q,r)-generation for given primes
   - The choice of commutator word u affects which n work
   - Known: A_15 is the smallest alternating Hurwitz group ((2,3,7)-generated)
   - Miller (1901): A_n for n not in {6,7,8} can be (2,3)-generated

5. WHY FORMALIZATION FAILED

   a) OPEN PROBLEM: This appears to remain unsolved. The "?" in the problem
      statement suggests uncertainty about the infinite case.

   b) MISSING MATHLIB INFRASTRUCTURE:
      - No theory of free groups with relations
      - No formal definition of commutator words
      - No (p,q,r)-generation theory
      - No triangle group quotient theory

   c) PROOF COMPLEXITY:
      - Likely requires classification of finite simple groups
      - Needs asymptotic arguments about alternating groups
      - Universal quantification over all commutator words is challenging

6. OUTCOME
   Created formalization_attempt_summary.txt with detailed analysis.
   The problem is too open-ended and requires mathematical infrastructure
   not currently available in Mathlib to formalize properly.
