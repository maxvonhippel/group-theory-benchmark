This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended question asking "What can be said about ⟨x, y⟩ in the case it is an infinite group?" This type of exploratory question seeks qualitative characterization or classification rather than posing a specific conjecture or statement that could be proven true or false. To formalize this, one would need a specific conjecture about what properties the infinite group ⟨x, y⟩ must satisfy.
