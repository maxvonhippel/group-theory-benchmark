This problem cannot be formalized because it involves two concepts beyond current Mathlib capabilities: (1) "radical classes" of groups - a specialized notion requiring closure under homomorphic images, normal subgroups, and generation by normal K-subgroups, which is not formalized in Mathlib; and (2) first-order definability ("formulae of Narrow Predicate Calculus") which requires a meta-logical framework representing first-order formulas and their semantics over groups. The question is also inherently about proper classes (collections of groups closed under isomorphism) rather than sets, adding further complexity to any type-theoretic formalization.
