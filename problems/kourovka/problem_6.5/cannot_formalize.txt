This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 with current Mathlib because it requires two advanced concepts not available in the library: (1) "type (FP)∞" - a homological finiteness condition requiring projective resolutions over group algebras, and (2) "constructible groups" in the Baumslag-Bieri sense, which requires HNN-extensions. Neither HNN-extensions nor the FP∞ finiteness condition are formalized in Mathlib, and defining them from scratch would require substantial foundational work in geometric group theory and homological algebra.
