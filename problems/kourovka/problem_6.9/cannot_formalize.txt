The problem refers to "locally normal groups," which is not a standard term in modern group theory literature and is not defined in Mathlib. The concept appears to originate from Gorchakov's specific research on infinite groups (published primarily in Russian), and the exact definition is not universally established. Different sources use "locally normal" to mean: (1) every finitely generated subgroup is normal, (2) every element has a finitely generated normal closure, or (3) specific properties related to conjugacy class sizes. Without access to Gorchakov's precise definition, a correct formalization cannot be constructed.
