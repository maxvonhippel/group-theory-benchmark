Kourovka Notebook Problem 6.9 (Yu. M. Gorchakov)

Is the derived subgroup of any locally normal group decomposable into a product
of at most countable subgroups which commute elementwise?

DEFINITIONS:
- A group G is **locally normal** if every finite subset of G is contained in
  some normal subgroup of G.
- The **derived subgroup** (or commutator subgroup) of G is [G, G], the subgroup
  generated by all commutators [a, b] = a⁻¹b⁻¹ab.
- A family of subgroups {Hᵢ}ᵢ **commute elementwise** if for any distinct i, j
  and elements a ∈ Hᵢ, b ∈ Hⱼ, we have ab = ba.
- A subgroup H is **decomposable into a product of at most countable subgroups {Hᵢ}**
  if H equals the subgroup generated by the union of {Hᵢ} where the index set is
  at most countable.

/--
A group G is **locally normal** if every finite subset is contained in a normal subgroup.
Equivalently, for any finitely many elements, there exists a normal subgroup containing them all.

/--
The derived subgroup (commutator subgroup) of G.
This is [G, G], the subgroup generated by all commutators.
In Mathlib, this is `commutator G` which equals `derivedSeries G 1`.

subgroups commute elementwise.

A subgroup H is the **join** (product) of a family of subgroups if H equals
the supremum (join) of all subgroups in the family.

/--
A subgroup H is **decomposable into a product of at most countable subgroups
which commute elementwise** if there exists a countable family of subgroups such that:
1. The index set I is at most countable
2. H is the join (supremum) of this family
3. Distinct subgroups in the family commute elementwise

Note: "at most countable" means the family has at most countably many subgroups,
i.e., the index set I is countable.

**Kourovka Problem 6.9** (Yu. M. Gorchakov):

Is the derived subgroup of any locally normal group decomposable into a product
of at most countable subgroups which commute elementwise?

This is stated as a conjecture: for every locally normal group G, its derived
subgroup [G, G] can be decomposed in this way.

Interpretation: The index set (number of subgroups in the decomposition) is
at most countable.

## Discussion

This problem asks whether the commutator subgroup of any locally normal group
has a specific structural decomposition property.

Key observations:
- Locally normal groups are a generalization of locally finite groups
- The derived subgroup being decomposable into countably many commuting pieces
  would impose significant structural constraints on [G, G]
- This relates to questions about the structure of commutator subgroups
  in various classes of groups

The problem was posed by Yu. M. Gorchakov in the context of understanding
the structure of derived subgroups in the class of locally normal groups.

Note on interpretation: "at most countable subgroups" means the family consists
of at most countably many subgroups (i.e., the index set is countable), not
that each individual subgroup has countable cardinality.
