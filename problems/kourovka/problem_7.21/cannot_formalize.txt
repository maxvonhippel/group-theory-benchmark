This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib because it relies on the "periodic product" construction, which is a highly specialized technical construction from Adian's work on the Burnside problem for groups of large odd exponent. This construction is not available in Mathlib and would require hundreds of lines of specialized definitions to properly formalize. The periodic product is fundamentally different from standard group products (direct product, free product, etc.) and involves a complex inductive limit construction specific to the theory of Burnside groups.
