This problem cannot be formalized because it concerns the "periodic product" (also called the Adian-Novikov periodic product or free Burnside product) of groups, which is a highly specialized construction from the theory of Burnside groups that is not available in Mathlib. The periodic product is defined using the deep machinery from Novikov and Adian's solution to the Burnside problem, involving intricate combinatorial and geometric group theory techniques. Without this foundational construction being formalized, the statement about minimum generators of periodic products cannot be meaningfully expressed in Lean 4.
