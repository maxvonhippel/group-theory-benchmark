This problem cannot be formalized because it is a meta-mathematical question about the decidability of certain decision problems in combinatorial group theory. The problem asks whether algorithms exist to decide (a) if a word is a Schaeffer word on every group, (b) if a word list is functionally complete on every group, (c) if a word is expressible in other words on every group, and (d) the same for finite groups. These are computability-theoretic questions asking "does an algorithm exist?" rather than asking for a mathematical theorem. Formalizing such problems would require encoding Turing machines or another model of computation and is fundamentally different from formalizing a theorem statement.
