  "problem_text": "The ordinal height of a variety of groups is, by definition, the supremum of order types (ordinals) of all well-ordered by inclusion chains of its proper subvarieties. It is clear that its cardinality is either finite or countably infinite, or equal to \u03c91. Is every countable ordinal number the ordinal height of some variety?\nA. V. Kuznetsov"
