  "problem_text": "Let G(K) be the Chevalley group over a commutative ring K associated with the root system \u03a6 as defined in (R. Steinberg, Lectures on Chevalley groups, Yale Univ., New Haven, Conn., 1967). This group is generated by the root subgroups xr(K), r \u2208 \u03a6. We define an elementary carpet of type \u03a6 over K to be any collection of additive subgroups {Ar | r \u2208 \u03a6} of K satisfying the condition\ncij,rs Air Aj s \u2286 Air+js\nfor r, s, ir + js \u2208 \u03a6, i > 0, j > 0,\nwhere cij,rs are constants defined by the Chevalley commutator formula and Air = {ai | a \u2208 Ar}. What are necessary and sufficient conditions (in terms of the Ar) on the elementary carpet to ensure that the subgroup \u27e8xr(Ar) | r \u2208 \u03a6\u27e9 of G(K) intersects with xr(K) in xr(Ar)?
