This problem cannot be formalized because it relies on the "periodic product" construction (Adian's periodic product of groups), which is a highly specialized concept from combinatorial group theory that is not defined in Mathlib. The periodic product is a specific quotient of the free product of groups by relations involving n-th powers, introduced in Adian's work on the Burnside problem. Defining this construction from scratch would require extensive infrastructure from combinatorial group theory (periodic words, Adian canonical forms, etc.) that is not currently available in Lean/Mathlib.
