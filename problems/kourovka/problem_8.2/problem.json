  "problem_text": "Let G be the amalgamated free product of two polycyclic groups, amalgamating a normal subgroup of each. Is G isomorphic to a linear group? G is residually finite (G. Baumslag, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 106, no. 2 (1963), 193\u2013209) and the answer is \u201cyes\u201d if the amalgamated part is torsion-free, abelian (B. A. F. Wehrfritz, Proc. London Math. Soc., 27, no. 3 (1973), 402\u2013424) and nilpotent (M. Shirvani, 1981, unpublished). B. A. F. Wehrfritz"
