  "problem_text": "We say that an automorphism \u03c6 of the group G is a pseudo-identity if, for all x \u2208 G, there exists a finitely generated subgroup Kx of G such that x \u2208 Kx and \u03c6|Kx is an automorphism of Kx. Let G be generated by subgroups H, K and let G be locally nilpotent. Let \u03c6 : G \u2192 G be an endomorphism such that \u03c6|H is pseudo-identity of H and \u03c6|K is an automorphism of K. Does it follow that \u03c6 is an automorphism of G? It is known that \u03c6 is a pseudo-identity of G if, additionally, \u03c6|K is pseudo-identity of K; it is also known that \u03c6 is an automorphism if, additionally, K is normal in G.\nP. Hilton",
