  "problem_text": "Suppose that a finite group G is generated by a conjugacy class D of involutions and let Di = {d1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 di | d1, . . . , di are different pairwise commuting elements of D}. What is G, if D1, . . . , Dn are all its different conjugacy classes of involutions? For example, the Fischer groups F22 and F23 satisfy this condition with n = 3.\nA. A. Makhn\u0308ev"
