Podufalov, Abstracts of the 9th All\u2013Union Symp. on Group Theory, Moscow, 1984, 113\u2013114 (Russian)) allows us to construct a projective plane of order 3: one can take as lines any class of subgroups of order 2 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 17 conjugate under S and add four more lines in a natural way. In a similar way, one can construct projective planes of order p^n for any prime p and any natural n. Could this method be adapted for constructing new planes?\nN. D. Podufalov"
