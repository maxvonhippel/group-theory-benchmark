PROBLEM SUMMARY
================================================================================

Kourovka Notebook Problem (Well-known problem):
"Is the group of collineations of a finite non-Desarguesian projective plane
defined over a semifield soluble?"

Posed by: N. D. Podufalov

The problem asks whether the full automorphism group (collineation group) of
any finite projective plane coordinatized by a proper semifield (not a field)
is always a solvable group.

Equivalent formulations:
- Algebraic: If K is a finite semifield but not a field, is the autotopism
  group of K always solvable?
- Geometric: For any finite translation plane over a semifield, is the
  collineation group solvable?

================================================================================
INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. PROBLEM STATUS: OPEN

   This is a well-known open problem in finite geometry and group theory.
   It appears in the Kourovka Notebook (a famous collection of unsolved
   problems in group theory, published since 1965).

2. PARTIAL RESULTS (all supporting the conjecture):

   - p-primitive semifield planes of order q^4: solvable autotopism group
   - Semifield planes of order p^4 (4|p-1): SL(2,5) cannot be a subgroup
   - Goologlu-Kolsch commutative semifields: solvable autotopism group
   - Commutative Dickson semifields: solvable autotopism group
   - Planes admitting Q_8, S_3, or A_4 subgroups: extensively studied

3. NO COUNTEREXAMPLE KNOWN

   Despite decades of research, no semifield plane with a non-solvable
   collineation group has been found.

4. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

   Recent literature (2025) notes: "There is not much evidence in favor of
   this conjecture, outside of some explicit examples of semifields with
   solvable autotopism group." However, no evidence against it exists either.

================================================================================
WHY FORMALIZATION FAILED
================================================================================

The problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 / Mathlib due to missing
infrastructure:

1. Semifields (non-associative division rings) not defined in Mathlib
2. Finite projective planes not formalized
3. Coordinatization theory for projective planes unavailable
4. Regular sets and translation planes not available
5. Collineation groups require plane structure first

Formalizing just the problem STATEMENT would require extensive foundational
work (hundreds of definitions) for specialized geometric structures.

================================================================================
COMPUTATIONAL EXPLORATION (GAP)
================================================================================

Used GAP to explore relevant group theory:

- GL(2,2): order 6, SOLVABLE
- GL(2,3): order 48, SOLVABLE
- GL(2,4): order 180, NOT SOLVABLE
- GL(2,5): order 480, NOT SOLVABLE
- GL(4,2): order 20160, NOT SOLVABLE (isomorphic to A_8)

The autotopism group of a semifield plane is a subgroup of GL(n,p) x GL(n,p)
with geometric constraints. Even though the ambient group may be non-solvable,
all known semifield autotopism groups are solvable.

GAP lacks built-in support for semifields or projective planes.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This is a genuine open problem that cannot be resolved computationally or
formally with current tools. The problem requires:

1. New mathematical techniques for the general case, OR
2. Discovery of a counterexample semifield

Neither GAP exploration nor Lean formalization can advance this problem
without substantial new infrastructure or mathematical breakthroughs.
