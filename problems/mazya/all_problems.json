This classical boundary value problem is in an unsatisfactory state both from theoretical and numerical points of view.\n\nProblem. Verify the following conjecture. The Neumann-Kelvin problem becomes Fredholm if the above formulation is completed by prescribing the elevation of the free surface on a part of the water line L, to be more precise, by adding the values of \u2202u/\u2202x at those points of L where the angle between the exterior normal to L and the x-axis is not greater than \u03c0/2.\n\nNote that the asymptotics of u near the curve L is not known. However, the existence of \u2202u/\u2202x is suggested by the asymptotic formula (8.8) in [38] obtained for the two-dimensional case."
