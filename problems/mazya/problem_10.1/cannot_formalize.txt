This problem cannot be formalized because it contains an open-ended research directive ("Study properties of this extension") rather than a precise mathematical statement. Additionally, the problem references external material ([79, Section 12.2.2]) for the spectrum description of operator A, and uses vague language ("is reminiscent of") to describe the relationship between the fundamental solution and the modified Riemann zeta function, making it impossible to capture a precise claim. Mathlib also lacks the necessary PDE infrastructure (fundamental solutions for parabolic equations, spectral theory of integral operators on manifolds) to even state this problem formally.
