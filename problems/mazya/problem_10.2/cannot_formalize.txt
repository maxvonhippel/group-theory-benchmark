This problem cannot be formalized because it asks for an open-ended classification: "Give a complete characterization of the uniqueness sets for analytic functions in the class A1,p(U)." This is a meta-mathematical request asking researchers to discover and describe what uniqueness sets look like, not a specific mathematical statement to prove. Additionally, the problem explicitly states it is "still open," meaning the characterization itself is unknown and thus cannot be stated as a theorem.
