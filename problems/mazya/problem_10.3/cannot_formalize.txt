This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "extend the class of domains with preservation of convergence" for iterative methods from reference [34], which is essentially asking researchers to find weaker sufficient conditions for convergence than the "strong convexity type" conditions used in the original work. This is a meta-mathematical research goal (discover new theorems) rather than a specific conjecture or statement that can be formalized as a Lean theorem.
