This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research problem asking to "extend the class of domains" for which certain iterative procedures (from reference [34]) converge. The problem does not state a specific conjecture or theorem to verify; rather, it asks for new mathematical results that generalize existing work. Additionally, the specific iterative schemes, convergence criteria, and the exact "strong convexity type" conditions to be weakened are not provided in the problem statement, making formalization impossible.
