This problem cannot be properly formalized because it asks to "find the best value of the isoperimetric constant C" - this is an open research problem asking for a specific numerical/analytic value, not a theorem statement. A formalization would require knowing what C is to state "C equals [value]", but discovering that value IS the problem. Additionally, the fractional perimeter P_α(Ω) defined as a double integral over Ω and its complement is not available in Mathlib, making even the setup infrastructure impossible to formalize properly.
