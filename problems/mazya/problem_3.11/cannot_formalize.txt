This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research question asking to "find" an unknown optimal constant C(p,γ) in a weighted Hardy inequality for the case p ≠ 2. The problem explicitly states that the known solution method for p = 2 does not extend to other values of p. Formalizing an open problem of the form "find X" is not meaningful since there is no specific mathematical statement to verify—it asks for a discovery rather than a proof of a known result.
