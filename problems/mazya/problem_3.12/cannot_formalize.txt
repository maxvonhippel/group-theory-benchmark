This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research problem asking to "find necessary and sufficient conditions" on σ for a trace inequality to hold. The problem does not state what those conditions are - it asks the reader to discover them. A proper formalization would require knowing the characterization, which is the content of the unsolved problem itself. Additionally, the problem involves distributions (generalized functions) on manifold boundaries, which goes beyond standard measure theory in Mathlib.
