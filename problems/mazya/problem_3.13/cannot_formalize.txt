This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "find a necessary and sufficient condition" rather than stating a specific conjecture to prove. The problem does not specify what the characterizing condition should be - it asks the solver to discover/characterize such a condition. Without knowing what condition to formalize, we cannot express this as a precise theorem statement in Lean.
