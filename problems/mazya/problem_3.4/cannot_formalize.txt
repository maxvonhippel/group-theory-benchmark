This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "find" necessary and sufficient conditions on a measure µ, rather than stating a specific theorem. The problem does not provide what those conditions are - it is asking the reader to discover them. To formalize this as a Lean theorem, we would need to know the explicit characterization of measures µ for which the embedding holds, but that characterization is precisely what the problem is asking someone to determine.
