This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 with current Mathlib because it requires Sobolev spaces L^{l,p}(Omega) (spaces of functions with weak derivatives up to order l in L^p), which are not available in Mathlib. Additionally, the problem involves Jordan domains (bounded open sets in R^2 with boundary homeomorphic to a circle), which also lack formalization in Mathlib. Both concepts are fundamental to the problem statement and cannot be reasonably approximated with existing definitions.
