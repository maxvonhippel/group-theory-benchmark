This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research problem asking to "find" (compute/determine) the least norm of an extension operator, rather than stating a theorem about a known value. Additionally, the required mathematical infrastructure (Sobolev spaces W^{1,2} on angular domains, extension operators with minimal norm) is not available in Mathlib, and formalizing these concepts from scratch would require substantial development beyond the problem statement itself.
