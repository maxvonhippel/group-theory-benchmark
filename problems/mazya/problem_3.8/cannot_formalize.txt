This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 because it fundamentally depends on the Wiener capacity (also called Newtonian capacity), which is not available in Mathlib. The Wiener capacity is a sophisticated concept from potential theory that requires the theory of Riesz potentials, equilibrium measures, and electrostatic energy - none of which are formalized in current Mathlib. The entire problem statement, including the capacitary distance d_α(x) and the Hardy inequality with this modified distance, depends on having a proper definition of cap(·) with its essential properties (monotonicity, subadditivity, scaling behavior, etc.). While one could define the capacity axiomatically, this would reduce the formalization to a nearly vacuous statement where all meaningful content is assumed rather than proven.
