This problem cannot be formalized because it asks "What is the best constant C?" for an uncertainty principle inequality for divergence-free vector fields. This is an open research problem asking to discover/compute optimal constants, not a theorem to prove. A formalization would require knowing the specific value of the optimal constant (which is not provided in the problem statement), and the problem explicitly asks the reader to determine this unknown value for both the p=2 case and the general p∈(1,∞) case.
