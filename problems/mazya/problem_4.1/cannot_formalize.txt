This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "develop a theory of solvability" for an integral equation, rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The problem is open-ended research guidance asking for existence, uniqueness, and regularity results, spectral properties, and connections to one-dimensional equations via the coarea formula - but no precise mathematical statement is given that could be expressed as a Lean theorem.
