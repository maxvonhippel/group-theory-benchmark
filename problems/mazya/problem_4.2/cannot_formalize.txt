This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib because it requires the theory of singular integral operators with homogeneous symbols on the unit sphere, which is not available in Mathlib. Specifically, the problem involves: (1) Calderón-Zygmund operators defined via principal value integrals, (2) the correspondence between symbols on ∂B₁ (the unit sphere) and singular integral operators on Lp(Rn), and (3) Lp operator norm bounds for such operators depending on oscillatory parameters. Additionally, the problem asks to "prove or disprove" an estimate, making it an open-ended question rather than a specific theorem statement to formalize.
