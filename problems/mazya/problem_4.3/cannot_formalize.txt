This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research problem asking to "find" a geometric representation for the Fredholm radius of the harmonic double layer potential. Unlike a theorem with a specific statement to prove, this problem asks researchers to discover an unknown formula or characterization. There is no target statement given that could be expressed as a Lean theorem - the problem is precisely asking someone to determine what that statement should be.
