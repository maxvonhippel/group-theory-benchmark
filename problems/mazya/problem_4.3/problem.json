Fredholm radius of the harmonic double layer potential\nConsidering the logarithmic harmonic potentials of the single and double\nlayer on curves of \u201cbounded rotation\u201d, J. Radon has introduced the notion of\nthe essential norm and the Fredholm radius of a bounded operator in 1919.\nThe essential norm \u2225L\u2225 of a linear bounded operator L acting on a\nBanach space B is defined as\n\n\u2225L\u2225 = inf_{ {K} } \u2225L \u2212 K\u2225_{B\u2192B},\n\nwhere {K} is the set of all linear compact operators on B.\nThe Fredholm radius R(L) of the operator L is the radius of the largest\ncircle on the complex \u03bb-plane centered at \u03bb = 0 inside which I + \u03bbL is a\nFredholm operator.\nThe essential norm \u2225L\u2225 is related to R(L) by the inequality\n\nR(L) \u2265 \u2225L\u2225^{\u22121}.\n\nIt was shown by I. Gohberg and A. Marcus [20] that the Fredholm radius\nof the operator L, acting on a Banach space B equipped with the norm \u2225\u00b7\u22250,\nsatisfies\n\nR(L) = sup{ \u2225L\u2225^{\u22121} : \u2225\u00b7\u2225 \u2208 N(\u2225\u00b7\u22250) },\n\nwhere \u2225L\u2225 is calculated with respect to a norm \u2225\u00b7\u2225 in the set N(\u2225\u00b7\u22250) of all\nnorms in B, equivalent to \u2225\u00b7\u22250.\nKr\u00e1l [35] and Burago and Maz\u2019ya [5] showed that for a n-dimensional\nbounded domain D with finite variation of the solid angle \u03c9_D(p, E) (p \u2208\n\u2202D, E \u2282 R^n) the essential norm of the harmonic double layer potential in\nthe Banach space C(\u2202D) is\n\n(2/(n v_n)) lim_{\u03b4\u21920} sup_{p\u2208\u2202D} var \u03c9_D(p, B_\u03b4(p)).\n\nReferences to other results in the same area can be found in [36, Chapter 7].\nProblem. Find a geometrical representation for the Fredholm radius of the\nharmonic double layer potential as an operator in C(\u2202D)."
