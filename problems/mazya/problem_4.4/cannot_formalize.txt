This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "Develop a theory of multidimensional boundary integral equations for domains with inner and outer cusps," which is a request to construct new mathematical framework, not to prove a specific theorem or verify a concrete claim. Without a specific mathematical statement (e.g., "Prove that property X holds for multidimensional layer potentials on cusped domains"), there is no formal proposition to encode in Lean.
