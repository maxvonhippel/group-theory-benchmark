Potential theory for surfaces with cusps\nA detailed theory of boundary integral equations for harmonic and elastic\nsinge and double layer potentials on curves with exterior and interior cusps\nwas constructed in [93].\nProblem. Develop a theory of multidimensional boundary integral equations\nfor domains with inner and outer cusps.\nFirst results concerning the multidimensional case can be found in [84]-[86]."
