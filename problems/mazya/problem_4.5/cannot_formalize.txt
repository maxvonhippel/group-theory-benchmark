This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research direction rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "obtain results" on solvability of boundary integral equations "under minimal requirements" on the boundary - both phrases are inherently vague and do not specify a concrete conjecture to formalize. Additionally, the specific boundary integral equations, the notion of "minimal" regularity requirements, and the precise meaning of "solvability" are not defined, making it impossible to state a formal theorem.
