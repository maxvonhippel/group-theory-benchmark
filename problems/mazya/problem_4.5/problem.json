  "problem_text": "4.5. Regularity of domains in the theory of boundary integral equations\nIn [90] (see also [88, Chapter 15]) a regularity theory of classical boundary integral equations involving harmonic, elastic and hydrodynamic potentials on nonsmooth surfaces is presented. A goal of this theory is to establish solvability in fractional Besov spaces.\nProblem. Obtain results on the solvability of just mentioned equations in Sobolev spaces Ll,p(\u2202\u2126) with integer l under minimal requirements on \u2202\u2126."
