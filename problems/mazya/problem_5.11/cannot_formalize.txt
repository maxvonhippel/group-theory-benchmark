This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 for multiple reasons:

1. It is an open "prove or disprove" problem, meaning the truth value is unknown - we cannot state it as a theorem without knowing the answer.

2. The mathematical objects involved (polyharmonic Green's functions with Dirichlet boundary conditions on arbitrary domains, the Dirac delta distribution as a fundamental solution) are not available in Mathlib. There is no theory of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, no polyharmonic operator, and no framework for boundary value problems on domains.

3. The statement requires showing a bound that is uniform over ALL domains in R^n, which is a sophisticated result in PDE theory well beyond current Mathlib capabilities.
