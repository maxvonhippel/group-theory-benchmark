This problem cannot be formalized because it asks open-ended research questions ("Is it possible to extend (5.13)?" and "Is the constant 2 best possible?") rather than stating a precise theorem or conjecture. Additionally, the required mathematical infrastructure (m-harmonic capacity, Riesz capacity of order 2m, capacitary potentials, Sobolev spaces, and distribution theory) is not available in Mathlib.
