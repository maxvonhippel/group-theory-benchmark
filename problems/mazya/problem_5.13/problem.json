The m-harmonic capacity of a compact set F in Rn is defined by\ncap_m(F) = inf {\n  \\sum_{|\\alpha|=m} \\frac{m!}{\\alpha!} \\|\\partial^\\alpha u\\|^2_{L_2(\\mathbb{R}^n)} : u \\in C_0^\\infty(\\Omega),\n  u = 1 in a neighborhood of F\n} \n(5.11)\nwas introduced in [50] (see also [53]) and proved to be useful in the theory of higher order elliptic equations. It is well-known that cap_m(F) = 0 for all compact sets F if 2m \\ge n.\n\nLet n > 2m. One of the definitions of the potential-theoretic Riesz capacity of order 2m is as follows:\nR_{2m}(F) = inf {\n  \\sum_{|\\alpha|=m} \\frac{m!}{\\alpha!} \\|\\partial^\\alpha u\\|^2_{L_2(\\mathbb{R}^n)} : u \\in C_0^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^n),\\ u \\ge 1 \\text{ on } F\n}.\n(5.12)\nThe capacities cap_m(F) and R_{2m}(F) are equivalent, that is their ratio is bounded and separated from zero by positive constants depending only on n and m (see [57], [62] and [71, Section 13.3]).\n\nThe minimizer in R_{2m} is a Riesz potential of a measure whereas that in cap_m is a Riesz potential of a distribution. The last minimizer will be denoted by U_F. By [67], for the dimensions n = 5, 6, 7 if m = 2 and n = 2m+1, 2m+2 if m > 2, the inequalities\n0 < U_F(x) < 2\n(5.13)\nhold for all x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus F. In general, the constant 2 cannot be replaced by 1.\n\nProblem. Is it possible to extend (5.13) for dimensions n \\ge 8 if m = 2, and n \\ge 2m + 3 for m > 2? Another question: is the constant 2 in (5.13) best possible?"
