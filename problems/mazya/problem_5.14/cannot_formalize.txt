This problem cannot be formalized because it references definitions (equations 5.11 and 5.12) that are not provided in the problem statement. The m-harmonic capacity cap_m and Riesz capacity R_{2m} are technical objects from potential theory whose precise definitions depend on the ambient dimension, function spaces (Sobolev spaces), and variational formulations that are not available in Mathlib. Without the explicit definitions of these capacities, any formalization would be speculative rather than faithful to the original problem.
