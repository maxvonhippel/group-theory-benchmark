This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 with current Mathlib because it requires advanced PDE concepts that are not available: (1) the inner normal derivative of a harmonic function at a boundary point of a Lipschitz domain, (2) domains defined by Lipschitz graph boundaries of the form xₙ > ϕ(x'), (3) the modulus of continuity ω(r) = sup_{|x'|<r} |∇ϕ(x')| for Lipschitz functions (involving essential supremum of the gradient), and (4) improper integrals of the form ∫ ω²(r)/r dr and ∫ ϕ(ξ)/|ξ|ⁿ dξ with singularities. The problem statement is also inherently about characterizing when a certain property holds for ALL harmonic functions on such domains, which requires substantial elliptic PDE theory (Hopf boundary lemma generalizations, boundary regularity theory) that is not formalized in Mathlib.
