Normal derivative of a harmonic function at a boundary point\nLet a \u03b4-neighborhood of the origin O \u2208 \u2202\u2126 be given by the inequality xn > \u03d5(x\u2032), where \u03d5 is a Lipschitz function of the variable x\u2032 \u2208 R^{n\u22121}, \u03d5(0) = 0. We assume that the function\n\n\u03c9(r) = sup_{|x\u2032|<r} |\u2207\u03d5(x\u2032)|\n\nsatisfies\n\n\u222b_0^\u03b4 \u03c9^2(r)/r \\, dr < \u221e.  (5.14)\n\nConsider also the condition\n\n\u222b_{|\u03be|<\u03b4} \u03d5(\u03be) \\, d\u03be / |\u03be|^n < \u221e,  (5.15)\n\nwhere the integral is improper.\n\nThe following property of harmonic functions appeared in mathematical literature at the end of the XIX century: if a harmonic function takes its minimum value at O, then its inner normal derivative at O is strictly positive.\n\nProblem. Prove that under the a priori requirement (5.14), the condition (5.15) is necessary and sufficient for the validity of the just formulated property of harmonic functions.\n\nNote that (5.15) is much weaker than the Dini condition\n\n\u222b_0^\u03b4 \u03c9(r)/r \\, dr < \u221e\n\nwhich previously appeared in the same context (see [2], where other references can be found).\n\nRemark. One possible approach is to use the asymptotic formula for harmonic functions near the Lipschitz boundary established in [30]."
