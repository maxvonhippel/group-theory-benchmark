This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib because it requires the concept of "essential spectrum" for unbounded self-adjoint operators, which is not available in Mathlib. The essential spectrum is a specialized notion from spectral theory of unbounded operators that differs from the ordinary spectrum by excluding isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. Additionally, formalizing the polyharmonic operator (−Δ)^m + q(x) as a self-adjoint operator on L²(ℝⁿ) with appropriate domain (involving Sobolev spaces and quadratic form theory) would require substantial infrastructure that is not currently present in Mathlib.
