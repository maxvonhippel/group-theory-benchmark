Essential spectrum of a perturbed polyharmonic operator\nConsider the selfadjoint operator L in L^2(R^n) generated by the differential expression\n\n(\u2212\u0394)^m + q(x),\n\nwhere q is a locally integrable nonnegative function in R^n.\n\nProblem. Let m > 1 and 2m \u2264 n. Is it true that either the essential spectrum of L coincides with the half-axis \u03bb \u2265 0, or the point \u03bb = 0 does not belong to the spectrum of L?\n\nThis \u201cspectral alternative\u201d was established by Putnam [98] for n = 1, m = 1, by Glazman [19] for n \u2265 1, m = 1, and by Yafaev [107] for 2m > n."
