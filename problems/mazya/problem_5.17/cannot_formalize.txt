This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "find necessary and sufficient conditions" rather than stating a specific conjecture or theorem to verify. The problem asks for a characterization of when lower-order terms preserve the singularity behavior of Green's functions, but does not specify what those conditions are - discovering them is the mathematical content of the problem. Additionally, Mathlib lacks the required infrastructure for Green's functions of elliptic operators with measurable bounded coefficients.
