This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "describe" and "find" asymptotic behavior of PDE solutions near tangency points, rather than stating a specific conjecture to verify. The problem asks for discoveries (asymptotic expansions, regularity results) that are currently unknown, not verification of a precise mathematical statement. Additionally, the underlying theory of degenerate PDEs with tangent vector fields on manifolds is not available in Mathlib.
