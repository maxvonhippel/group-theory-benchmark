  "problem_text": "In 1972 [59] I published a result related to the generic degeneration, still\nthe only known one. I assumed that there are smooth manifolds\n\n\u03930 \u2283\u03931 . . . \u2283\u0393s\n\nof dimensions n \u22122, n \u22123, . . . , n \u22122 \u2212s such that l is tangent to \u0393j exactly\nat the points of \u0393j+1, whereas l is nowhere tangent to \u0393s. A local model of\nthis situation is given by the following:\n\n\u2126= {x \u2208Rn : x1 > 0},\n\u0393 = {x1 = 0},\nl = x2\u22021 + x3\u22022 + . . . + xk\u2202k\u22121 + \u2202k,\nk \u2264n,\n\u0393j = {x1 = x2 = . . . = x2+j = 0},\nj = 0, . . . , k \u22122.\n\nSome function spaces of the right-hand side and solutions ensuring the\nunique solvability of the problem are found in [59]. The success was achieved\nby a choice of weight functions in the derivation of a priori estimates for the\nsolution. Additionally, I proved that the inverse operator of the problem is\nalways compact on Lp(\u0393), 1 < p \u2264\u221e. It turned out that the tangent mani-\nfolds of codimension greater than one do not in\ufb02uence the correct statement\nof the problem, contrary to Arnold\u2019s expectations.\n\nHowever, the following problem is still unsolved.\nProblem. Describe the asymptotic behaviour of solutions near the points of\ntangency of the \ufb01eld l. In particular, it seems challenging to \ufb01nd asymptotics\nnear the point of \u03931 whose neighbourhood contains both points of entrance\nand exit of the \ufb01eld l with respect to \u0393.\n\nMore generally, it would be interesting to obtain regularity results for\nstrong solutions of the generic degenerating problem."
