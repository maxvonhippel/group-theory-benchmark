This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive asking to "develop a theory of solvability" for a class of boundary value problems, rather than stating a specific theorem or conjecture to prove. The problem asks for the creation of a mathematical framework (involving pseudodifferential operators, boundary conditions, and solvability criteria) rather than making a precise mathematical claim that could be expressed as a Lean theorem statement.
