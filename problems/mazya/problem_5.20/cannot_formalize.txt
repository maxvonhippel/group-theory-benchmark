This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "obtain estimates of the same nature" as those in an external reference [32, Chapter 10] for the case n ≤ 2m + 1, but without knowing the exact form of those estimates (specific weighted norms, weight functions, and inequality structure), there is no well-defined statement to formalize. Additionally, "coercive weighted estimates" for elliptic PDEs in domains with cusps involve specialized weighted Sobolev spaces whose precise definitions depend on the cusp geometry and are not specified in the problem statement.
