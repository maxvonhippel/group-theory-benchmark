This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib because it involves highly specialized PDE concepts that are not available in the current library. Specifically, it requires: (1) the Lamé system from elasticity theory (a system of PDEs), (2) domains with non-Lipschitz graph conical vertices at boundary points, (3) the associated Dirichlet problem and solution theory for such singular domains, and (4) generalized maximum principles in this setting. These are research-level topics in partial differential equations and geometric analysis that go far beyond current Mathlib formalization capabilities.
