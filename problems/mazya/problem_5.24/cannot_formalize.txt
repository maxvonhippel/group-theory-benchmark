This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open research question asking to "prove or disprove" whether the displacement vector is uniformly bounded for the Neumann problem of linear elasticity in domains with non-Lipschitz graph conical vertices. Since the truth value of the statement is unknown (it's an open problem), we cannot formalize it as either a theorem or its negation. Additionally, the problem requires specialized PDE concepts (linear elasticity system, non-Lipschitz conical singularities, stress/strain tensors, Neumann boundary conditions on singular domains) that are not currently available in Mathlib.
