This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open research question asking "Is it possible to replace R^{n+1}_+ by a smooth domain?" and "Can one replace the Laplace operator by an arbitrary second order elliptic operator?" These are meta-mathematical questions about whether certain generalizations of a known theorem hold, not precise mathematical statements to prove. Additionally, the problem explicitly states that certain regularity conditions are "not to be specified here," making a complete formalization impossible.
