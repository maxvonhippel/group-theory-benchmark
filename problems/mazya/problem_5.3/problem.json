  "problem_text": "5.3. Uniqueness in the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation\nLet R^{n+1}_+ = {(p, t) : p \u2208 R^n, t > 0}. Suppose a function u \u2208 C^1(R^{n+1}_+ \u222a R^n) is harmonic in R^{n+1}_+ and its Dirichlet data has zero of infinite order at the origin. Moreover, let the normal derivative satisfy\n|\u2202u/\u2202t (p)| \u2264 h(|p|),   p \u2208 R^n,  (5.4)\nwhere h is a function defined on [0, \u221e) positive on (0, \u221e) and such that h(r) \u2193 0 as r \u2193 0. One can ask for which h it is true that (5.4) implies u = 0. The following answer to this question was obtained in [76].\nSuppose h satisfies certain regularity conditions (not to be specified here), then (5.4) implies u = 0 if and only if\n\u222b_0^1 log h(r) dr = \u2212\u221e.  (5.5)\nBy Kelvin\u2019s transform, the criterion (5.5) can be stated for harmonic functions in a ball. However, the method of proof given in [76] does not provide an answer to the following question.\nProblem. Is it possible to replace R^{n+1}_+ in the above exposition by a smooth domain? Also, can one replace the Laplace operator by an arbitrary second order elliptic operator with smooth coefficients?\nIn this case, it is only known that the uniqueness follows from the estimate\n|\u2207u(x)| \u2264 exp(\u22121/|x|^c)\nwith a certain positive c (see [39]) and with c = 2 + \u03b5, \u03b5 > 0, (see [41])."
