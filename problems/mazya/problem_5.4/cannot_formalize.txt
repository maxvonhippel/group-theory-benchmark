This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open problem asking to "prove or disprove" whether the De Giorgi-Nash property (local Hölder continuity of weak solutions) holds for uniformly elliptic equations with complex-valued coefficients in dimensions n = 3 and n = 4. Since the truth value is unknown, we cannot state a definitive theorem. Additionally, the required mathematical infrastructure (weak solutions of elliptic PDEs, Sobolev spaces, local Hölder regularity for distributions) is not sufficiently developed in Mathlib to express this problem precisely.
