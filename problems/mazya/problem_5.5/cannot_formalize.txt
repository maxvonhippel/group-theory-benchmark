This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem simply says "Address this issue" regarding the lack of theory for elliptic boundary value problems on Hölder graph domains analogous to the existing theory for Lipschitz graph domains. This is a call to develop new mathematical theory, not a specific theorem, conjecture, or well-defined question that can be expressed as a formal statement in Lean.
