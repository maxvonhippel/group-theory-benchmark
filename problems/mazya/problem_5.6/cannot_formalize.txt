This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 with current Mathlib because it requires several advanced PDE concepts that are not available: (1) Jordan domains in R^2 (requires the Jordan curve theorem which is not formalized), (2) strongly elliptic operators L_{2m} with their symbol and ellipticity conditions, (3) variational/weak solutions of higher-order elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions (requires Sobolev spaces H^m_0(Ω) and the associated variational formulation), and (4) the m-th order gradient ∇^m u and its L^{4-ε} integrability. These are fundamental concepts in PDE theory that would require substantial new Mathlib development before this problem could be properly stated.
