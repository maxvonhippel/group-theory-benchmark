This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended question asking to "describe the asymptotic behaviour" of a quantity rather than stating a specific conjecture to prove. The problem asks what happens to α(n) as n → ∞, without proposing a concrete asymptotic formula or bound. Additionally, formalizing the optimal Hölder exponent for harmonic capacitary potentials of n-dimensional cubes would require extensive development of potential theory, capacity, and corner regularity theory not currently available in Mathlib.
