H\u00a8older regularity of capacitary potential of n-dimensional cube\nIt can be easily proved by a barrier argument that the harmonic capacitary\npotential of the cube {x : 0 \u2264 x_i \u2264 1, i = 1, . . . , n} belongs to a certain\nH\u00a8older class C^{\u03b1(n)}, 0 < \u03b1(n) < 1, which gives rise to the following\nProblem. Describe the asymptotic behaviour of \u03b1(n) as n \u2192 \u221e."
