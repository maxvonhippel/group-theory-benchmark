This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to (1) prove that a given condition is NOT sufficient (requiring construction of a counterexample) and (2) "find a sharp sufficient condition" for self-adjointness, which is asking for mathematical discovery rather than verification of a known statement. The problem explicitly asks the solver to determine what the correct condition should be, making it impossible to state as a precise theorem without already knowing the answer to the open problem.
