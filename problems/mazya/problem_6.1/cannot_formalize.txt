This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research direction rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem states that "no analogue is known" for higher-order nonlinear equations and asks for the development of such a theory - this is a request for future mathematical research, not a conjecture that can be stated as a theorem. Additionally, the necessary PDE infrastructure (p-Laplacian, variational solutions in cones, asymptotic expansions near singularities) is not available in Mathlib.
