This problem cannot be formalized because it concerns the p-Laplacian operator Δ_p u = div(|∇u|^{p-2} ∇u), which is a nonlinear PDE operator not available in Mathlib. The problem requires the theory of weak solutions to nonlinear elliptic PDEs, Sobolev spaces W^{1,p}, and spectral theory for the p-Laplacian on spherical domains - none of which are currently formalized. Additionally, the statement involves a characterization of all positive p-harmonic functions in cones satisfying certain boundary conditions, which requires advanced PDE machinery far beyond what is currently available in Lean/Mathlib.
