This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 / Mathlib because it involves the p-Laplace equation, p-capacity (a potential-theoretic concept), weak solutions of nonlinear PDEs, and energy integral estimates - none of which have adequate infrastructure in Mathlib. The p-Laplacian operator div(|∇u|^(p-2)∇u), the p-capacity definition as an infimum over test functions, and the associated regularity theory for solutions would all need to be built from scratch without connection to any existing theory. A formalization would be an empty shell of opaque definitions with no mathematical substance.
