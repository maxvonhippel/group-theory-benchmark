This problem cannot be formalized because it references "system (6.7)" which was not included in the extracted problem text. The problem statement begins mid-sentence with "has the weak discontinuous solution" and asks about isolated singularities of solutions to this undefined system. Without the explicit PDE system definition, the mathematical question cannot be precisely stated in Lean.
