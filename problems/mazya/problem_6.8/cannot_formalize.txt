This problem cannot be properly formalized in Lean 4 because it involves qualitative analytical concepts that lack precise definitions in Mathlib. Specifically, the notion of "logarithmic singularity" (asymptotic behavior like c·log(r) near a boundary point) and the informal statement "depends upon an arbitrary constant" (describing the solution space dimension) are not readily expressible. Additionally, the problem requires formalizing solutions to a nonlinear PDE (Δu + αu²ₓ + βu²ᵧ = 0) on smooth bounded planar domains with specific boundary regularity, which exceeds current Mathlib infrastructure for PDE theory.
