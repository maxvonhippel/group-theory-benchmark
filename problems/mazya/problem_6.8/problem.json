We assume that\nthe solution u satisfies u = 0 on \u2202\u2126\\{O}.\nProblem. Prove that either u = 0 on \u2202\u2126, or u has a logarithmic singularity\nat O and depends upon an arbitrary constant.\nA formal asymptotic expansion of u near O can be found in [92], also\nfor more general equations."
