This problem cannot be formalized because it is open-ended and exploratory rather than a precise theorem statement. The problem asks to "describe an asymptotic behaviour" and "what happens if A is not positive-definite" - these are investigative questions seeking characterizations, not claims to be verified. Additionally, the notion of "behaves as t at any positive distance from the boundary" is left imprecise, and formalizing the full PDE setup (semi-linear parabolic equations on bounded domains with Dirichlet conditions, gradient nonlinearities, and asymptotic analysis) would require substantial infrastructure not currently available in Mathlib.
