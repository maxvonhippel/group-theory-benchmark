This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended characterization problem asking to "give a complete characterization of the measure µ" satisfying certain inequalities. The problem itself acknowledges that the answer is unknown, stating "A necessary condition... obviously holds... Most probably, it is also sufficient." Formalizing this would require knowing the characterization itself, but discovering that characterization IS the unsolved problem. Additionally, formalizing parabolic capacity and the relevant Sobolev spaces (L^{-1,2}(Ω) as dual of L^{1,2}_0(Ω)) would require substantial infrastructure not currently in Mathlib.
