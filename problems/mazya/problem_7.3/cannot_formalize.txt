This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "describe" the space of boundary traces, rather than stating a specific mathematical claim to verify. Additionally, the required concepts (maximal operators for the wave equation, trace theory for operator domains, and Besov spaces) are not available in Mathlib. Even the special case mentioned in the remark, which identifies the trace space as the Besov space B^{1/2,2}(R^n) for the half-space, cannot be formalized without these foundational definitions.
