By \u25a1 denote the maximal operator generated by \u25a1_{x,t}, i.e. the closure of \u25a1_{x,t} defined on C^\u221e(\u2126) in the norm\n\n( ||\u25a1_{x,t}u||^2_{L^2(\u2126)} + ||u||^2_{L^2(\u2126)})^{1/2}.\n\nProblem. Describe the space of boundary traces for functions in the domain of \u25a1.\n\nRemark. If \u2126 = R^{n+1}_+ = { (x,t) : x \u2208 R^n, t > 0 }, then by [18, Corollary 4.6.2] the traces in question make up the Besov space B^{1/2,2}(R^n)."
