This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research direction rather than a precise mathematical statement. The problem asks to "obtain a similar result" for nonlinear hyperbolic operators analogous to a linear result from referenced papers, but does not specify what form such a result should take. Additionally, the exact technical conditions from the referenced papers ([106], [22], [6]) are not provided, making it impossible to state a precise conjecture. This is a meta-mathematical question about the existence of theorems of a certain type, not a formalizable statement.
