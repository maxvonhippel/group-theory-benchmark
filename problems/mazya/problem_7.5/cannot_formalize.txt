This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research question asking to "describe" or characterize the boundary traces of functions, rather than stating a specific theorem to be verified. The problem explicitly points to "possible development of the theory" for variable coefficient operators, indicating the answer is not yet known. Formalizing would require stating a precise characterization that the problem itself is asking researchers to discover.
