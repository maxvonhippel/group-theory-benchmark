This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended characterization problem asking to "characterize" which domains satisfy a certain PDE estimate (inequality 7.6). The problem does not state a theorem to be proven; rather, it asks researchers to find necessary and sufficient conditions for when Lp estimates hold for various differential operators on unbounded domains. Additionally, the referenced inequality (7.6) is not provided in the problem statement, making formalization impossible even if the problem were not open-ended.
