Let L(D) be a di\ufb00erential operator in Rn with constant coe\ufb03cients.\nCharacterise the domains satisfying (7.6).\n\nExample. For L(D) = \u2206\u22121, any domain is admissible whereas for L(D) = \u2206,\nn = 3, inequality (7.6) holds if and only if \u2126 does not contain balls with\narbitrary radii. For n \u2265 4, one needs the notion of biharmonic capacity to\nformulate a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition in terms of a capacitary inner\nradius (see [71, Chapter 16]).\n\nOne can even ask the same question for special operators.
