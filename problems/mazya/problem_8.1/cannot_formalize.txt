This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib because it involves the resolvent operator for the Dirichlet-Stokes system, which requires Sobolev spaces for divergence-free vector fields, the Stokes operator as an unbounded operator on Lp spaces, and resolvent theory for such operators - none of which are currently available in Mathlib. Additionally, Part 1 asks to "justify a conjecture" (an open problem), making it a research question rather than a theorem statement. The geometric conditions in Part 2 (reentrant dihedral angles with specific openings along (n-2)-dimensional submanifolds) also require substantial geometric infrastructure not present in Mathlib.
