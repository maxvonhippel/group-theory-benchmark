This problem cannot be formalized because it involves the Stokes and Navier-Stokes systems of PDEs, which require infrastructure not available in Mathlib: vector-valued Sobolev spaces on bounded domains, the divergence-free condition as a constraint, weak/variational solutions to PDE systems, and the specific function spaces (C^{0,1}, L^{1,2}_0) with their norms. The problem asks to extend a 2D regularity result (Lipschitz bounds for q > 2) to 3D (q > 3), requiring PDE regularity theory that goes well beyond current Lean/Mathlib capabilities.
