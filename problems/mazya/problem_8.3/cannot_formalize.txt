This problem cannot be formalized because it references "the Dirichlet problem (8.1)" which is an equation from the source document that is not provided. Additionally, Mathlib lacks the necessary infrastructure for the Stokes system (vector-valued Sobolev spaces with divergence-free constraints, pressure variables, and the variational formulation for Stokes equations in 3D domains). The problem is also an open research question asking to "prove or disprove" a conjecture about L^∞ boundedness of variational solutions.
