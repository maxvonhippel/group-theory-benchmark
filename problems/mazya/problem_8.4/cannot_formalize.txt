This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4/Mathlib for several reasons:

1. The problem concerns resolvent estimates for the Dirichlet-Stokes operator, which requires PDE infrastructure (Stokes equations, unbounded operators on Lp spaces, resolvent operators for PDEs, Sobolev spaces for vector-valued functions with boundary conditions) that does not exist in Mathlib.

2. Part 1 explicitly asks to "justify a conjecture" - this is an open research problem, not a theorem statement that can be formalized as a true proposition.

3. Part 2 requires geometric concepts (domains with reentrant dihedral angles, smooth (n-2)-dimensional submanifolds as edges) that are not available in Mathlib.
