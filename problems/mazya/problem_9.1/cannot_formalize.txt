This problem cannot be formalized because it involves advanced PDE theory (the Neumann-Kelvin problem for surface waves) and asks whether a specific boundary value problem "becomes Fredholm" under certain conditions. Formalizing this would require: (1) Sobolev space theory on domains with complex geometry (wetted surfaces, water lines), (2) trace operators and regularity theory for elliptic PDEs, and (3) Fredholm operator theory applied to PDE systems - none of which are adequately developed in Mathlib. Furthermore, the problem statement is inherently vague about the geometry of the body and the precise functional-analytic setup required to make "becomes Fredholm" mathematically precise.
