Well-posed Neumann-Kelvin problem for a surface-piercing body\nWhen solving the seakeeping problem with forward speed which is called Neumann-Kelvin problem, one looks for a velocity potential u(x, y, z) defined on a lower half-space outside the wetted part S of a body moving in the x-direction. The normal derivative of u is prescribed on S and the condition\n\n\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2 + \u03bd \u2202u/\u2202z = 0,\n\u03bd = const > 0,\n\nshould be satisfied on the flat surface F outside the body (see [38, Chapter 8]). This classical boundary value problem is in an unsatisfactory state both from theoretical and numerical points of view.\n\nProblem. Verify the following conjecture. The Neumann-Kelvin problem becomes Fredholm if the above formulation is completed by prescribing the elevation of the free surface on a part of the water line L, to be more precise, by adding the values of \u2202u/\u2202x at those points of L where the angle between the exterior normal to L and the x-axis is not greater than \u03c0/2.\n\nNote that the asymptotics of u near the curve L is not known. However, the existence of \u2202u/\u2202x is suggested by the asymptotic formula (8.8) in [38] obtained for the two-dimensional case."
