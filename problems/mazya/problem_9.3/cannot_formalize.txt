This problem cannot be formalized for several reasons:

1. **Missing critical context**: The problem references equations (9.1), (9.2), (9.3) and "geometrical assumptions from Section 48" which are not provided, making it impossible to state the boundary value problem precisely.

2. **Construction request**: The problem asks to "construct an example" of a domain Ω that demonstrates non-solvability - this is a request for a counterexample construction rather than a theorem statement that can be formalized.

3. **Specialized PDE infrastructure**: Even with complete context, formalizing harmonic oscillations in fluid domains with radiation conditions at infinity requires specialized analysis machinery (Sobolev spaces on unbounded domains, radiation conditions, etc.) that is not readily available in Mathlib.
