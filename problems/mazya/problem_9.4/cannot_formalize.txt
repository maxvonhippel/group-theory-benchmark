This problem (Hardy-Leray inequality for divergence-free fields) could potentially be formalized as an inequality statement, but it poses an implicit question ("it is natural to ask whether this restriction can improve the constant") rather than stating a concrete theorem to prove. The problem describes known results from reference [10] about axisymmetric divergence-free fields having an improved constant, but doesn't state a specific open problem or theorem. Additionally, formalizing this would require Sobolev space infrastructure and careful treatment of divergence-free vector fields in Mathlib that is not readily available.
