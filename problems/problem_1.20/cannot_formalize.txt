This problem cannot be properly formalized because it is an open-ended classification question asking "for which groups (classes of groups)" have a certain property. The problem seeks to characterize or classify all groups where the lattice of normal subgroups is first-order definable in the lattice of all subgroups - it is not asking to prove a specific theorem but rather to determine what the complete answer to this classification question is. Without a known or conjectured characterization (e.g., "exactly the groups satisfying property P"), there is no single mathematical statement to formalize.
