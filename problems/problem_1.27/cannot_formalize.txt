This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "describe" the universal theory of free groups, which is an open-ended research problem requesting a characterization or explicit presentation rather than a precise theorem to prove. The problem is asking what the complete axiomatization of the universal theory (all ∀-only first-order sentences true in all free groups) looks like, not asking to prove a specific mathematical statement. Such descriptive/classification problems do not have natural formalizations as Lean theorems.
