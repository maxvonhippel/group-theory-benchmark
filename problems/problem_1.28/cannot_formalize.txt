This problem cannot be formalized because it asks to "describe" the universal theory of free nilpotent groups, which is an open-ended research directive rather than a precise mathematical statement. A formalization would require either: (1) a specific conjecture about what the universal theory is, or (2) a specific property of the universal theory to prove. The problem as stated is asking for a characterization/classification, similar to "describe all groups with property X," which cannot be captured as a single theorem statement in Lean.
