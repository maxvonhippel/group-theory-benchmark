Kourovka Notebook Problem 1.12 (W. Magnus) asks about the DECIDABILITY of the isomorphism problem to the trivial group for balanced presentations (groups with n generators and n defining relations, where n > 2). This is a meta-mathematical question about whether there exists an algorithm to solve this decision problem, not a mathematical theorem to prove. Formalizing decidability questions requires encoding computability theory (Turing machines, recursive functions, or equivalent), which is fundamentally different from formalizing a mathematical statement like "every group with property X has property Y." The problem is asking "Is there an algorithm that...?" rather than stating a provable mathematical fact.
