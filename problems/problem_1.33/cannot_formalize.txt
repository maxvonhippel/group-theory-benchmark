This problem cannot be formalized because it is an open-ended research problem asking to "describe" the automorphism group of a free solvable group, rather than stating a specific theorem or property to prove. "Describe" is not a formal mathematical statement - it asks for a characterization or structural result, which would require knowing the answer first (e.g., "the automorphism group is isomorphic to X" or "the automorphism group has property Y"). Without a specific claim to formalize, there is no theorem statement to write in Lean.
