Does there exist a finitely generated semigroup S with cancellation having non-exponential growth and such that its group of left quotients G = S\u22121S (which exists) is a group of exponential growth? An affirmative answer would give a positive solution to Problem 12 in (S. Wagon, The Banach\u2013Tarski Paradox, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985). R. I. Grigorchuk"
