  "problem_text": "Let \u0393 be an almost polycyclic group with no non-trivial finite normal subgroups, and let k be a field. The complete ring of quotients Q(k\u0393) is a matrix ring Mn(D) over a skew field. Conjecture: n is the least common multiple of the orders of the finite subgroups of \u0393. An equivalent formulation (M. Lorenz) is as follows: \u03c1(G0(k\u0393)) = \u03c1(G0(k\u0393)F), where G0(k\u0393) is the Grothendieck group of the category of finitely-generated k\u0393-modules, G0(k\u0393)F is the subgroup generated by classes of modules induced from finite subgroups of \u0393, and \u03c1 is the Goldie rank. There is a stronger conjecture: G0(k\u0393) = G0(k\u0393)F. G. A. Noskov",
  "answer": "The strong conjecture G0(k\u0393) = G0(k\u0393)F has been proved (J. A. Moody, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 17 (1987), 113\u2013116)."
