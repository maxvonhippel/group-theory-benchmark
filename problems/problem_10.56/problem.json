  "answer": "No. The lattice L of all varieties of nilpotent 2-groups of class \u2a7d 4 is non-distributive (Yu. A. Belov, Algebra and Logic, 9, no. 6 (1970), 371-374; R. A. Bryce, Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London (A), 266 (1970), 281\u2013355, footnote on p. 335). The mapping V \u2192 V \u2229 F, where F is the class of all finite groups, is an embedding of L into the lattice of formations.
