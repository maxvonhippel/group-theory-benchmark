  "problem_text": "Suppose that G is a periodic group having an infinite Sylow 2-subgroup S which is either elementary abelian or a Suzuki 2-group, and suppose that the normalizer NG(S) is strongly embedded in G and is a Frobenius group (see 6.55) with locally cyclic complement. Must G be locally finite? V. P. Shunkov",
