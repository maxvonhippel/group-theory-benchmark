  "problem_text": "A union A = S\u03b1 V\u03b1 of varieties of groups (in the lattice of varieties) is called irreducible if S\u03b2\u0338=\u03b1 V\u03b2 \u0338= A for each index \u03b1. Is every variety an irreducible union of (finitely or infinitely many) varieties each of which cannot be decomposed into a union of two proper subvarieties?\nA. Yu. Ol\u2019shanski\u02d8\u0131"
