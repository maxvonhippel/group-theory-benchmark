  "problem_text": "20.14. (a) Do there exist a variety V of groups and a group G \u2208 V such that the coproduct in V of two copies of G is embeddable in G, but the coproduct of three such copies is not? See (G. M. Bergman, Indag. Math., 18 (2007), 349\u2013403).\nGiven an embedding G \u2217V G \u2192 G, one might expect the induced map\nG \u2217V (G \u2217V G) \u2192 G \u2217V G \u2192 G\nto be an embedding. But this is not automatic, because in a general group variety V, a map G \u2217V A \u2192 G \u2217V B induced by an embedding A \u2192 B is not necessarily again an embedding.\n(b) If there exist V and G as in (a), does there in fact exist an example with V the variety of groups generated by G? For this and related questions, see (G. M. Bergman, Algebra Number Theory, 3 (2009), 847\u2013879). G. M. Bergman"
