  "problem_text": "Let Rpk be the variety of class 2 nilpotent groups of exponent pk, where p is a prime number and k \u2a7e2. It is true that for every p and k there are infinitely many subquasivarieties of Rpk each of which is generated by a finite group with derived subgroup of exponent pk and does not have an independent basis of quasi-identities?\nA.
