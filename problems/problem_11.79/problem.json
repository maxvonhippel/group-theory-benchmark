  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite group of automorphisms of an infinite field F of character-\nistic p. Taking integral powers of the elements of F and the action of G define the\naction of the group ring ZG of G on the multiplicative group of F. Is it true that any\nsubfield of F that contains the images of all elements of F under the action of some\nfixed element of ZG \\ pZG contains infinitely many G-invariant elements of F?\nK. N.
