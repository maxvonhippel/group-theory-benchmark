Comment of 2024: This is true for the class of alternating groups (M. Larsen, P. H. Tiep, Preprint, 2023, arXiv:2305.04806) and for any class of groups of Lie type of bounded Lie rank (S. V. Skresanov, Preprint, 2024, https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12506).\n\u2217b) The same conjecture for the groups PSL(2, p).\nL. Pyber",
