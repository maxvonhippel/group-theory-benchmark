  "problem_text": "This question is about existence of an analogue of the Lazard correspondence for pre-Lie algebras and braces. A pre-Lie algebra A is a vector space with a bilinear operation (x, y) \u2192 xy satisfying (xy)z \u2212 x(yz) = (yx)z \u2212 y(xz) for every x, y, z \u2208 A. A pre-Lie algebra A is said to be left nilpotent if, for some n \u2208 N, A\u00b7(A\u00b7(A \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A))) = 0 where A appears n times in the product. Recall that a set A with binary operations + and \u25e6 is a left brace if (A, +) is an abelian group, (A, \u25e6) is a group, and a \u25e6 (b + c) + a = a \u25e6 b + a \u25e6 c for every a, b, c \u2208 A. Let p be a prime, and F_p the field of p elements. A left brace A is called an F_p-brace if its additive group is an F_p-vector space such that a \u2217 (\u03b1b) = \u03b1(a \u2217 b) for all a, b \u2208 A, \u03b1 \u2208 F_p, where a \u2217 b = a \u25e6 b \u2212 a \u2212 b. The idea of a connection between braces and pre-Lie algebras comes from a paper by W. Rump (2014).\n\na) Let A be an F_p-brace of cardinality p^k for some k. Is it true that when p is sufficiently large relative to k, the set A with the same additive operation + and with the operation \u00b7 defined as a \u00b7 b = \u2212\\sum_{i=0}^{p\u22122} \\frac{1}{2^i} ((2^i a) \u2217 b) is a pre-Lie algebra?\nComment of 2025: If 2 \u2261 \u03be^{p^{n\u22121}} when \u03be is a primitive root modulo p, and if A is strongly nilpotent of nilpotency index less than p, then the result follows by (A. Smoktunowicz, Adv. Math., 409, part B (2022), 108683). It is not known if the result follows when A is not strongly nilpotent.\n\nb) Let k be a natural number, and let p be a prime number such that p > 2k. Is there a bijective correspondence between F_p-braces of cardinality p^k and left nilpotent pre-Lie algebras over F_p of cardinality p^k?\n\nAn affirmative answer to any of the above questions would have consequences for the theory of set-theoretic solutions of the Yang\u2013Baxter equation and for the theory of Hopf\u2013Galois extensions.\nA.
