  "problem_text": "A group G is called of type (FP)\u221e if the trivial G-module Z has a resolution by finitely generated projective G-modules. The class of all groups of type (FP)\u221e has a couple of excellent closure properties with respect to extensions and amalgamated products (R. Bieri, Homological dimension of discrete groups, Queen Mary College Math. Notes, London, 1976). Is every periodic group of type (FP)\u221e finite? This is related to the question whether there is an infinite periodic group with a finite presentation. R. Bieri"
