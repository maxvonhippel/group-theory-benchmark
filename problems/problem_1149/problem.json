  "problem_text": "Let G be a pro-p group that is a 3-dimensional Poincar\u00b4e duality group. Is\nG coherent?\nA group is said to be coherent if each of its finitely generated subgroups is finitely\npresented, and in the question the coherency is used in the pro-p sense. The question\nis a famous problem for abstract groups, but has a positive answer for 3-manifold\ngroups.\nP. Zalesskii"
