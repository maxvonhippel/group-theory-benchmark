  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite almost simple group such that Soc(G) is a non-soluble group of Lie type over a field of characteristic p. Let R be a Sylow q-subgroup of G (for some q) and let MinG(R) be the subgroup of R generated by all minimal by inclusion intersections of the form R \u2229 Rg, where g \u2208 G. Is it true that for p > 3 the subgroup MinG(R) is non-trivial if and only if the following hold: G = Aut(L2(p)), where p is a Mersenne prime, MinG(R) = R, and q = 2. It is known that this is not always the case for p = 2, 3. V. I. Zenkov",
  "answer": "Yes, it is true (T. C. Burness, H. Y. Huang, Preprint, 2025, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19745)."
