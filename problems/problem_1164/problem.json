A totally imprimitive p-group H of finitary permutations is said to have the cyclic-block property if in the cycle decomposition of every element the support of every cycle is a block for H. Let G be a transitive subgroup of the group of finitary permutations FSym(\u2126) of a set \u2126. Does every transitive Sylow p-subgroup of G contain a transitive subgroup which has the cyclic-block property?\nA. O. Asar"
