Since \u03c4r1(k),r2(k) permutes the residue classes modulo k, the group CTk is isomorphic to the symmetric group Sk. Let CT(k) = \u27e8CT2, CT3, . . . , CTk\u27e9. Is it true that for k > 3 the group CT(k) is isomorphic to the symmetric group SN, where N is the least common multiple of the numbers 2, 3, . . . , k?\nV. G. Bardakov, A. L. Iskra"
