  "problem_text": "Suppose that G is a finite group, and A1, A2, A3 are subsets of G such that the multiplication map A1 \u00d7 A2 \u00d7 A3 \u2192 G is bijective. Must the subgroup \u27e8A2\u27e9 generated by A2 have order divisible by the cardinality |A2|? This is Question 8 in (G. M. Bergman, J. Iranian Math. Soc., 1 (2020), 157\u2013161). It is known (ibid.) that the corresponding statement is true for the subgroups \u27e8A1\u27e9 and \u27e8A3\u27e9. Moreover, |A2| will at least divide the order of the least subgroup containing A2 and closed under conjugation by members of A1, and similarly of the least subgroup containing A2 and closed under conjugation by members of A3.
