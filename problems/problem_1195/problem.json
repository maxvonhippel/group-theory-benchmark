By definition, a constructible totally disconnected, locally compact (tdlc) group is the result of a sequence of profinite extensions and ascending HNN-extensions starting from the trivial group. As in the discrete case, soluble constructible tdlc groups have type FP\u221e (G. C. Cook, I. Castellano, J. Algebra, 543 (2020), 54\u201397).\nAre soluble tdlc groups of type FP\u221e constructible?\nG. C. Cook"
