  "problem_text": "21.41. A group is said to be self-similar if it admits a faithful state-closed representation by automorphisms of a regular one-rooted m-tree for some m. Can a torsion-free finitely presented metabelian group which is self-similar contain a subgroup isomorphic to the restricted wreath product H = Z \u2240 Z?\nIt is known that Z \u2240 Z itself is self-similar (A. C. Dantas, T. M. G. Santos, S. N. Sidki, J. Algebra, 567 (2021), 564\u2013581).\nA. Dantas, S. Sidki"
