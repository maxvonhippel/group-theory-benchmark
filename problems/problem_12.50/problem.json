Find an algorithm which decides, by a given finite set of matrices in SL3(Z), whether the first matrix of this set is contained in the subgroup generated by the remaining matrices. An analogous problem for SL4(Z) is insoluble since a direct product of two free groups of rank 2 embeds into SL4(Z).\nG. S. Makanin"
