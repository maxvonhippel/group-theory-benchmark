  "problem_text": "Let d be an integer that is not divisible by n-th powers of primes, let x^n \u2212 d be an irreducible polynomial over Q, let \u03b8 = n\u221ad, and let K = Q(\u03b8) be the radical extension of degree n of the field Q. The multiplicative group K* of the field K is canonically embedded into the group AutQ(K) of all invertible Q-linear mappings of the Q-space K; let T be the image of K* under this embedding. In the natural basis 1, \u03b8, \u03b8^2, . . . , \u03b8^(n\u22121) of the Q-space K the group AutQ(K) corresponds to G = GL(n, Q), and the subgroup T to a subgroup T(d) (unsplit maximal torus). Every subgroup H of G containing T(d) and some one-dimensional transformation is rich in elementary transvections (V. A. Koibaev, St. Petersbg. Math. J., 21, no. 5 (2010), 731\u2013742) and thus defines a net \u03c3 = \u03c3(H) (V. A. Koibaev, A. V. Shilov, J. Math. Sci. New York 171, no. 3 (2010), 380\u2013385). Let E(\u03c3) denote the subgroup generated by all transvections in the net group G(\u03c3). Is it true that H \u2a7d NG(E(\u03c3))?\nThis inclusion was proved in the case n = 2 (V. A. Koibaev, Dokl. Math., 41, no. 3 (1990), 414\u2013416).\nV. A. Koibaev"
