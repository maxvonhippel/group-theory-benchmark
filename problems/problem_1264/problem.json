A first order formula \u03c6(x) in the group language with one free variable is\nsaid to be concise in a class C of groups if for every group G in C such that the set\nG\u03c6 of elements in G satisfying \u03c6 is finite, the subgroup \u03c6(G) generated by G\u03c6 is also\nfinite (cf. 21.105 and Archive 2.45). Is every formula with one free variable concise\nin the class of residually finite groups?\nM. Petschick"
