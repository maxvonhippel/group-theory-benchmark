  "problem_text": "A group G is said to be virtually special if G has a finite-index subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of a special complex (in the sense of F. Haglund, D. T. Wise, Geom. Funct. Anal., 17, no. 5 (2008), 1551\u20131620; cf 20.60.) A group G is called a CAT(0) group if it acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly by isometries on a CAT(0) metric space.\n a) Is every CAT(0) free-by-cyclic group virtually special?\n b) A weaker question: does every CAT(0) free-by-cyclic group virtually embed into a right-angled Artin group?\nI.
