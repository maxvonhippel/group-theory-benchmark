  "problem_text": "Two groups G1 and G2 are said to be commensurable if there exist finite-index subgroups H1 \u2a7d G1 and H2 \u2a7d G2 (not necessarily of the same index) such that H1 \u223c= H2. Let A[F4] and A[H4] denote the Artin groups of spherical types F4 and H4, respectively. Are these two groups commensurable? This is the most difficult case in the classification of Artin groups of spherical type up to commensurability.\nI. Soroko"
