  "problem_text": "If the p-th powers in a finite p-group form a subgroup, must that subgroup be powerful? That is, for p \u2260 2, if the p-th powers in a p-group of exponent p2 form a subgroup, must that subgroup be abelian? For a 2-group of exponent 8, if the squares form a subgroup, must that subgroup be abelian?\nL. Wilson"
