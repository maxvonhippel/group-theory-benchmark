  "problem_text": "Let G = G1 \u2a3fH G2 be a free pro-p product of coherent pro-p groups with polycyclic amalgamation. Is G coherent?\nFor abstract groups this is known to be true. A group is said to be coherent if each of its finitely generated subgroups is finitely presented, and in the question the coherency is used in the pro-p sense.\nP. A. Zalesskii"
