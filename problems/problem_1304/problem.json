A group is of type Fn if it has a classifying space with finite n-skeleton. For example, type F1 is equivalent to finite generation, and type F2 is equivalent to finite presentability. Type F\u221e means type Fn for all n.\nFor n \u2a7e 3, does every group of type Fn\u22121 embed as a subgroup of a group of type Fn? Or even in a group of type F\u221e?\nM. C. B. Zaremsky"
