  "problem_text": "An automorphism \u03c6 of a linearly ordered group is called order preserving if x < y implies x\u03c6 < y\u03c6. Is it possible to order an abelian strictly isolated normal subgroup of an S-group (see Archive 1.47) in such a way that the order is preserved under the action of the inner automorphisms of the whole group?\nA. I. Kokorin",
