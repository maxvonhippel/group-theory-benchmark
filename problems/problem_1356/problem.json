  "problem_text": "Are there only finitely many conjugacy classes of maximal periodic subgroups in a finitely generated linear group over the integers?\nV. P. Platonov",
  "answer": "Not always. The extension H of the free group on free generators a, b by the automorphism \u03c6 : a \u2192 a\u22121, b \u2192 b is a linear group over the integers. For every n \u2208 Z the element cn = \u03c6b\u2212nabn has order 2 and CH(cn) = \u27e8cn\u27e9. Let the dash denote an isomorphism of H onto its copy H\u2032. As a counterexample one can take the subgroup G \u2a7d H \u00d7 H\u2032 generated by the elements a, \u03c6, a\u2032\u03c6\u2032, bb\u2032. Indeed, G contains the subgroups Tn = \u27e8c0, c\u2032n\u27e9, n \u2208 Z, which are maximal periodic (even in H \u00d7 H\u2032). If Tn and Tm are conjugate by an element xy\u2032 \u2208 G (where x \u2208 H and y\u2032 \u2208 H\u2032), then cx0 = c0 and cyn = cm, whence x \u2208 \u27e8c0\u27e9, y \u2208 bm\u2212n\u27e8cm\u27e9. Since xy\u2032 \u2208 G, the sums of the exponents at the occurrences of b in x and y (in any expression) must coincide; hence m = n. (Yu. I. Merzlyakov, 1973.)"
