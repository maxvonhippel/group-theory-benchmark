  "problem_text": "The width of a group G is, by definition, the smallest cardinal m = m(G) with the property that any subgroup of G generated by a finite set S \u2286 G is generated by a subset of S of cardinality at most m.\na) Does a group of finite width satisfy the minimum condition for subgroups?\nb) Does a group with the minimum condition for subgroups have finite width?\nc) The same questions under the additional condition of local finiteness. In particular, is a locally finite group of finite width a Chernikov group?\nL. N. Shevrin",
  "answer": "a) Not always (S. V. Ivanov, Geometric methods in the study of groups with given subgroup properties, Cand. Diss., Moscow Univ., Moscow, 1988 (Russian)).\nb) Not always (G. S. Deryabina, Math. USSR\u2013Sb., 52 (1985), 481\u2013490).\nc) Yes, it is (V. P. Shunkov, Algebra and Logic, 9 (1970), 137\u2013151; 10 (1971), 127\u2013142)."
