  "answer": "Yes, it is. By (G. N\u00f6beling, Invent. Math., 6 (1968) 41\u201355) the additive group of all bounded integer-valued functions on an arbitrary set is free. Hence the group of all continuous integer-valued functions on the Chech compactification of an arbitrary discrete space is also free. For any compact space X there exists a continuous mapping of the Chech compactification Y of a discrete space onto X. This induces an embedding of the group of continuous integer-valued functions on X into the free group of continuous integer-valued functions on Y. (V. I. Kuz\u2019minov, 1969.)"
