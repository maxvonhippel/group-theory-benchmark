  "problem_text": "A group G is called an FN-group if the groups \u03b3iG/\u03b3i+1G are free abelian and\nT\u221e\ni=1 \u03b3iG = 1, where \u03b3i+1G = [\u03b3iG, G]. A variety of groups M is called a \u03a3-variety\n(where \u03a3 is an abstract property) if the M-free groups have the property \u03a3.\na) Which properties \u03a3 are preserved under multiplication and intersection of vari-\neties? Is the FN property preserved under these operations?\nb) Are all varieties obtained by multiplication and intersection from the nilpotent\nvarieties N1, N2, . . . (where N1 is the variety of abelian groups) FN-varieties?\nA. I. Mal\u2019cev",
  "answer": "a) The property FN is preserved by multiplication of varieties (A. L. Shmel\u2019kin, Trans.\nMoscow Math. Soc., 29 (1973), 239\u2013252). The property FN is not preserved by the\nintersection of varieties. The following example is due to L. G. Kov\u00b4acs. Let U and\nV be the varieties of all nilpotent groups of class at most 4 satisfying the identities\n[x, y, y, x] \u22611 and [[x, y], [z, t]] \u22611, respectively. Then U and V are FN-varieties\nbecause 1) both of them are nilpotent of class 4 and contain all nilpotent groups of\nclass \u2a7d3, and 2) relatively free groups in U and V are torsion-free (well-known for V\nand follows for U from (P. Fitzpatrick, L. G. Kov\u00b4acs, J. Austral. Math. Soc. Ser. A,\n35, no. 1 (1983), 59\u201373)). On the other hand, U\u2229V is not an FN-variety because the\nrelatively free group in U \u2229V of rank 3 is not torsion-free. Indeed, every torsion-free\ngroup in U \u2229V is of class \u2a7d3 (follows from the paper by Fitzpatrick and Kov\u00b4acs\ncited above), and there is a 3-generated (exponent 2)-by-(exponent 2) group of class\nprecisely 4 in U \u2229V. (A. N. Krasil\u2019nikov, Letter of July, 17, 1998.)\nb) Yes (Yu. M. Gorchakov, Algebra i Logika, 6, no. 3 (1967), 25\u201330 (Russian))."
