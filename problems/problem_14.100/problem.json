  "problem_text": "Is it true that in a Shunkov group (i. e. conjugately biprimitively finite group, see 6.59) having infinitely many elements of finite order every element of prime order is contained in some infinite locally finite subgroup? This is true under the additional condition that any two conjugates of this element generate a soluble subgroup (V. P. Shunkov, Mp-groups, Moscow, Nauka, 1990 (Russian)).\nA. K. Shl\u00a8epkin"
