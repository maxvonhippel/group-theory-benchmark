  "problem_text": "Let G be an infinite group admitting non-discrete Hausdorff group topologies, and L (G) the lattice of all group topologies on G.\na) Is it true that for any natural number k there exists a non-refinable chain \u03c40 < \u03c41 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c4k of length k of Hausdorff topologies in L (G)? (For countable nilpotent groups this is true (A. G. Topale, Deposited in VINITI, 25.12.98, no. 3849\u2013V 98 (Russian)).)\nb) Let k, m, n be natural numbers and let G be a nilpotent group of class k. Suppose that \u03c40 < \u03c41 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c4m and \u03c4\u20320 < \u03c4\u20321 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c4\u2032n are non-refinable chains of Hausdorff topologies in L (G) such that \u03c40 = \u03c4\u20320 and \u03c4m = \u03c4\u2032n. Is it true that m \u2a7d n\u00b7k and this inequality is best-possible? (This is true if k = 1, since for G abelian the lattice L (G) is modular.)\nc) Is it true that there exists a countable G such that in the lattice L (G) there are a finite non-refinable chain \u03c40 < \u03c41 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c4k of Hausdorff topologies and an infinite chain {\u03c4\u2032\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} of topologies such that \u03c40 < \u03c4\u2032\u03b3 < \u03c4k for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393?\nd) Let G be an abelian group, k a natural number. Let Ak be the set of all those Hausdorff group topologies on G that, for every topology \u03c4 \u2208 Ak, any non-refinable chain of topologies starting from \u03c4 and terminating at the discrete topology has length k. Is it true that Ak \u2229 {\u03c4\u2032\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} \u0338= \u2205 for any infinite non-refinable chain {\u03c4\u2032\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} of Hausdorff topologies containing the discrete topology? (This is true for k = 1.)\nV. I. Arnautov",
  "answer": "b) The inequality does hold, but it is not sharp (V. I. Arnautov, Bull. Acad. S\u00b8tiint\u00b8e Repub. Moldova, Mat., 2010, no. 2 (2010), 3\u201319).\nd) No; moreover, no infinite abelian group satisfies this property with k = 2 (D. Peng, Preprint, 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08269)."
