  "problem_text": "Suppose that G is a triply transitive group in which a stabilizer of two points\ncontains no involutions, and a stabilizer of three points is trivial. Is it true that G\nis similar to PGL2(P) in its natural action on the projective line P \u222a {\u221e}, for some\nfield P of characteristic 2? This is true under the condition that the stabilizer of two\npoints is periodic.\nV. D. Mazurov"
