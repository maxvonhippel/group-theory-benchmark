  "problem_text": "Conjecture: There is a function f on the natural numbers such that, if \u0393 is\na finite, vertex-transitive, locally-quasiprimitive graph of valency v, then the number\nof automorphisms fixing a given vertex is at most f(v). (By definition, a vertex-\ntransitive graph \u0393 is locally-quasiprimitive if the stabilizer in Aut(\u0393) of a vertex \u03b1 is\nquasiprimitive (see 14.46) in its action on the set of vertices adjacent to \u03b1.)\nTo prove the conjecture above one need only consider the case where Aut(\u0393) has\nthe property that every non-trivial normal subgroup has at most two orbits on vertices\n(C. E. Praeger, Ars Combin., 19 A (1985), 149\u2013163). The analogous conjecture for\nfinite, vertex-transitive, locally-primitive graphs was made by R. Weiss in 1978 and\nis still open. For non-bipartite graphs, there is a \u201creduction\u201d of Weiss\u2019 conjecture\nto the case where the automorphism group is almost simple (see 14.46 for definition)\n(M. Conder, C. H. Li, C. E. Praeger, Proc. Edinburgh Math. Soc. (2), 43, no. 1 (2000),\n129\u2013138).\nComment of 2013: These conjectures have been proved in the case where there is\nan upper bound on the degree of any alternating group occurring as a quotient of a\nsubgroup (C. E. Praeger, L. Pyber, P. Spiga, E. Szab\u00b4o, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 140,\nno. 7 (2012), 2307\u20132318). Comment of 2021: This has been proved in the case where\nthe group induced on the neighbourhood of a vertex has an abelian regular normal\nsubgroup (P. Spiga, Bull. London Math. Soc., 48, no. 1 (2016), 12\u201318.) C. E. Praeger"
