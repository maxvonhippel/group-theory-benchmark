  "problem_text": "We associate with words in the alphabet x, x\u22121, y, y\u22121, z, z\u22121, . . . operations which are understood as functions in variables x, y, z, . . .. We say that a word A is expressible in words B1, . . . , Bn on the group G if A can be constructed from the words B1, . . . , Bn and variables by means of finitely many substitutions of words one into another and replacements of a word by another word which is identically equal to it on G. A list of words is said to be functionally complete on G if every word can be expressed on G in words from this list. A word B is called a Schaeffer word on G if every word can be expressed on G in B (compare with A. V. Kuznetsov, Matem. Issledovaniya, Kishin\u00a8ev, 6, no. 4 (1971), 75\u2013122 (Russian)). Does there exist an algorithm which decides\na) by a word B, whether it is a Schaeffer word on every group? Compare with the problem of describing all such words in (A. G. Kurosh, Theory of Groups, Moscow, Nauka, 1967, p. 435 (Russian)); here are examples of such words: xy\u22121, x\u22121y2z, x\u22121y\u22121zx.\nb) by a list of words, whether it is functionally complete on every group?\nc) by words A, B1, . . . , Bn, whether A is expressible in B1, . . . , Bn on every group? (This is a problem from A. V. Kuznetsov, ibid., p. 112.)\nd) the same for every finite group? (For finite groups, for example, x\u22121 is expressible in xy.) For a fixed finite group an algorithm exists (compare with A. V. Kuznetsov, ibid., \u00a7 8).\nA. V. Kuznetsov"
