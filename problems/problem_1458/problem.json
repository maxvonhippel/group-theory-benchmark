  "problem_text": "Is it true that every finite group with a group of automorphisms \u03a6 which acts regularly on the set of conjugacy classes of G (that is, leaves only the identity class fixed) is soluble? The answer is known to be affirmative in the case where \u03a6 is a cyclic group generated by a regular automorphism. A. I. Saksonov",
  "answer": "No, not always (Y. Fine, J. Group Theory, 22, no. 6 (2019), 1077\u20131087)."
