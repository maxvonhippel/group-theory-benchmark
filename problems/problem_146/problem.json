  "problem_text": "Is it true that the group SLn(q) contains, for sufficiently large q, a diagonal matrix which is not contained in any proper irreducible subgroup of SLn(q) with the exception of block-monomial ones? For n = 2, 3 the answer is known to be affirmative (V. M. Levchuk, in: Some problems of the theory of groups and rings, Inst. of Physics SO AN SSSR, Krasnoyarsk, 1973 (Russian)). Similar problems are interesting for other Chevalley groups.\nV. M. Levchuk"
