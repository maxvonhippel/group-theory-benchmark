  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite group, p an odd prime number, and P a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Let the order of every non-identity normal subgroup of G be divisible by p. Suppose P has an element x that is conjugate to no other from P. Does x belong to the centre of G? For p = 2, the answer is positive (G. Glauberman, J. Algebra, 4 (1966), 403\u2013420). G. Glauberman",
  "answer": "Yes, it does, mod CFSG (O. D. Artemovich, Ukrain. Math. J., 40 (1988), 343\u2013345)."
