  "problem_text": "b) We call a variety of groups a limit variety if it cannot be defined by finitely many laws, while each of its proper subvarieties has a finite basis of identities. It follows from Zorn\u2019s lemma that every variety that has no finite basis of identities contains a limit subvariety. Is the set of limit varieties countable?\nA. Yu. Olshanskii",
  "answer": "No, there are continuum of such varieties (P. A. Kozhevnikov, On varieties of groups of large odd exponent, Dep. 1612-V00, VINITI, Moscow, 2000 (Russian); S. V. Ivanov, A. M. Storozhev, Contemp. Math., 360 (2004), 55\u201362)."
