  "problem_text": "M. R. Vaughan-Lee and J. Wiegold (Proc. R. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 95 (1983), 215\u2013221) proved that if a finite p-group G is generated by elements of breadth \u2a7d n (that is, having at most p^n conjugates), then G is nilpotent of class \u2a7d n^2 + 1; the bound for the class was later improved by A. Mann (J. Group Theory, 4, no. 3 (2001), 241\u2013246) to \u2a7d n^2 \u2212 n + 1. Is there a linear bound for the class of G in terms of n?\nYa. G. Berkovich"
