  "problem_text": "For a class M of groups let L(M) be the class of groups G such that the normal subgroup \u27e8a^G\u27e9 generated by an element a belongs to M for any a \u2208 G. Is it true that the class L(M) is finitely axiomatizable if M is the quasivariety generated by a finite group?\nA. I. Budkin"
