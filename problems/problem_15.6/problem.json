  "problem_text": "(Well-known problem). Is it true that Golod p-groups are non-amenable? These infinite finitely generated torsion groups are defined in (E. S. Golod, Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2), 48 (1965), 103\u2013106). P. de la Harpe",
  "answer": "Yes, moreover, such groups have infinite quotients with Kazhdan\u2019s property (T) and are uniformly non-amenable (M. Ershov, A. Jaikin-Zapirain, Proc. London Math. Soc. (3), 102, no. 4 (2011), 599\u2013636)."
