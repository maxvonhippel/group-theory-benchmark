  "problem_text": "Let G be a pro-p group, p > 2, and \u03c6 an automorphism of G of order 2. Suppose that the centralizer C_G(\u03c6) is abelian. Is it true that G satisfies a pro-p identity?\nAn affirmative answer would generalize a result of A. N. Zubkov (Siberian Math. J., 28, no. 5 (1987), 742\u2013747) saying that non-abelian free pro-p groups cannot be represented by 2 \u00d7 2 matrices.\nA. Jaikin-Zapirain"
