  "answer": "The cardinality of the continuum. Every 2-generated group G is embeddable into a simple group H with two generators of orders 2 and 3 (P. E. Schupp, J. London Math. Soc., 13, no. 1 (1976), 90\u201394). Such a group H has at most countably many 2-generator subgroups, while there are continuum of groups G. (Yu. I. Merzlyakov, 1976.)"
