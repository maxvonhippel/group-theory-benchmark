A subvariety V of the variety N of all pronilpotent groups is said to be (locally) nilpotent if all (finitely generated) groups in V are nilpotent.\na) Is it true that any non-nilpotent subvariety of N contains a non-nilpotent locally nilpotent subvariety?\nb) The same problem for the variety of all pro-p-groups (for a given prime p).\nO.
