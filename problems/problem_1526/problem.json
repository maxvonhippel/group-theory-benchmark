  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite group with trivial soluble radical in which there are Sylow 2-subgroups having non-trivial intersection. Suppose that, for any two Sylow 2-subgroups P and Q of G with P \u2229 Q \u2260 1, the index |P : P \u2229 Q| does not exceed 2n. Is it then true that |P| \u2a7d 2^{2n}? V. V. Kabanov",
  "answer": "Yes, it is, mod CFSG (V. I. Zenkov, Algebra and Logic, 36, no. 2 (1997), 93\u201398)."
