  "answer": "Let x = \u03c31, y = \u03c32 be the standard generators of the braid group B3; then the braid (xyxyx)12(xy)\u221212(xyx)\u221212 belongs to the derived subgroup of B3 but is not a commutator (Yu. S. Sem\u00a8enov, Abstracts of the 10th All-Union Sympos. on Group Theory, Minsk, 1986, p. 207 (Russian))."
