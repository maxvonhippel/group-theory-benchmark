What can be said about the kernel and the complement of a Frobenius group? In particular, which groups can be kernels? complements?\nV. P. Shunkov",
  "answer": "Every group can be embedded into the kernel of a Frobenius group, and every right-orderable group can be a complement in a Frobenius group (V. V. Bludov, Siberian Math. J., 38, no. 6 (1997), 1054\u20131056)"
