NOTE: The problem was RESOLVED by prior work (shown to be independent of ZFC).
However, since the result is an independence proof requiring forcing theory,
it cannot be formalized in Lean (which lacks forcing machinery) or verified
computationally via GAP (which works with finite/computable groups).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
================================================================================

Kourovka Notebook Problem 16.44 (E. G. Zelenyuk):

"Is there in ZFC a countable non-discrete topological group not containing
discrete subsets with a single accumulation point? (Such a group is known
to exist under Martin's Axiom.)"

================================================================================
SOLUTION STATUS
================================================================================

The problem has been essentially RESOLVED: The answer is INDEPENDENT OF ZFC.

Key Result (Reznichenko-Sipacheva 2021):
- Any countable topological group in which the filter of neighborhoods of the
  identity element is NOT RAPID contains a discrete set with precisely one
  nonisolated point (i.e., a single accumulation point).

- The existence of a countable nondiscrete extremally disconnected group
  implies the existence of a RAPID ULTRAFILTER.

================================================================================
ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The question asks whether ZFC alone proves the existence of such a group.

1. UNDER MARTIN'S AXIOM (MA):
   - Rapid ultrafilters exist under MA
   - Under MA, countable nondiscrete groups without discrete subsets having
     a single accumulation point CAN exist
   - The problem statement acknowledges this: "Such a group is known to exist
     under Martin's Axiom"

2. IN MODELS WHERE NO RAPID ULTRAFILTERS EXIST:
   - It is consistent with ZFC that no rapid ultrafilters exist
   - By the Reznichenko-Sipacheva theorem, in such models:
     * Every countable nondiscrete topological group has a neighborhood filter
       that is not rapid
     * Therefore, every such group contains a discrete subset with exactly
       one accumulation point
   - Hence, in these models, NO such group exists

3. CONCLUSION:
   The answer to problem 16.44 is INDEPENDENT OF ZFC:
   - ZFC alone cannot prove such a group exists (because in some ZFC models,
     no rapid ultrafilters exist, and then no such group exists)
   - ZFC alone cannot prove such a group does not exist (because MA is
     consistent with ZFC, and under MA such groups exist)

================================================================================
KEY DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

- RAPID FILTER: A filter F on omega is rapid if for every function f: omega -> omega,
  there exists A in F such that |A intersect f(n)| <= n for all n.

- RAPID ULTRAFILTER: An ultrafilter that is also a rapid filter. The existence
  of rapid ultrafilters is independent of ZFC.

- DISCRETE SUBSET WITH SINGLE ACCUMULATION POINT: A sequence {x_n} of distinct
  points that converges to a single point x (with x not equal to any x_n).

================================================================================
MATHEMATICAL SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

This result connects several important areas:
1. Topological group theory
2. Set-theoretic topology
3. Ultrafilter theory and Ramsey theory
4. Independence results in ZFC

The problem illustrates how questions about topological groups can depend on
set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC, specifically on the existence of certain
special ultrafilters.

================================================================================
FORMALIZATION NOTES
================================================================================

A complete Lean formalization would require:
1. The theory of topological groups
2. Filters and ultrafilters (available in Mathlib)
3. The definition of "rapid" filters
4. Forcing and independence proofs (not fully available in Lean/Mathlib)

Since the main result is an independence result, a complete formal proof would
require formalized forcing machinery, which is beyond current Mathlib capabilities.
However, the positive direction (the Reznichenko-Sipacheva implication) could
potentially be formalized.

The formalization_attempt_summary.txt file explains why full formalization is
not feasible for this problem.
