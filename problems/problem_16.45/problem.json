  "problem_text": "16.45. Let G be a permutation group on a set \u2126. A sequence of points of \u2126is a base for G if its pointwise stabilizer in G is the identity; it is minimal if no point may be removed. Let b(G) be the maximum, over all permutation representations of the finite group G, of the maximum size of a minimal base for G. Let \u00b5\u2032(G) be the maximum size of an independent set in G, a set of elements with the property that no element belongs to the subgroup generated by the others. Is it true that b(G) = \u00b5\u2032(G)? (It is known that b(G) \u2a7d\u00b5\u2032(G), and that equality holds for the symmetric groups.) Remark. An equivalent question is the following. Suppose that the Boolean lattice B(n) of subsets of an n-element set is embeddable as a meet-semilattice of the subgroup lattice of G, and suppose that n is maximal with this property. Is it true that then there is such an embedding of B(n) with the property that the least element of B(n) is a normal subgroup of G? P. J. Cameron"
