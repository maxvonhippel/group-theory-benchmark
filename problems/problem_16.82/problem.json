  "problem_text": "Let X be a non-empty class of finite groups closed under taking homomorphic images, subgroups, and direct products. With every group G \u2208 X we associate some set \u03c4(G) of subgroups of G. We say that \u03c4 is a subgroup functor on X if:\n1) G \u2208 \u03c4(G) for all G \u2208 X, and\n2) for each epimorphism \u03c6 : A 7\u2192 B, where A, B \u2208 X, and for any H \u2208 \u03c4(A) and T \u2208 \u03c4(B) we have H\u03c6 \u2208 \u03c4(B) and T\u03c6\u22121 \u2208 \u03c4(A).\nA subgroup functor \u03c4 is closed if for each group G \u2208 X and for every subgroup H \u2208 X \u2229 \u03c4(G) we have \u03c4(H) \u2286 \u03c4(G). The set F(X) consisting of all closed subgroup functors on X is a lattice (in which \u03c41 \u2a7d \u03c42 if and only if \u03c41(G) \u2286 \u03c42(G) for every group G \u2208 X). It is known that F(X) is a chain if and only if X a class of p-groups for some prime p (Theorem 1.5.17 in S. F. Kamornikov and M. V. Sel\u2019kin, Subgroups functors and classes of finite groups, Belaruskaya Navuka, Minsk, 2001 (Russian)). Is there a non-nilpotent class X such that the width of the lattice F(X) is at most |\u03c0(X)| where \u03c0(X) is the set of all prime divisors of the orders of the groups in X ?\nA. N. Skiba",
  "answer": "No such classes exist (S. F. Kamornikov, Siberian Math. J., 51, no. 5 (2010), 824\u2013829)."
