  "problem_text": "Which finite simple groups can be generated by three involutions, two of which commute?\nV. D. Mazurov",
  "answer": "The answer is known mod CFSG. For the alternating groups and groups of Lie type see (Ya. N. Nuzhin, Algebra and Logic, 36, no. 4 (1997), 245\u2013256). For sporadic groups B. L. Abasheev, A. V. Ershov, N. S. Nevmerzhitskaya, S. Norton, Ya. N. Nuzhin, A. V. Timofeenko have shown that the groups M11, M22, M23, and McL cannot be generated as required, while the others can; see more details in (V. D. Mazurov, Siberian Math. J., 44, no. 1 (2003), 160\u2013164)."
