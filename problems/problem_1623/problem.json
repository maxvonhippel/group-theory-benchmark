  "problem_text": "We call a variety passable if there exists an unrefinable chain of its subvarieties which is well-ordered by inclusion. For example, every variety generated by its finite groups is passable \u2014 this is an easy consequence of (H. Neumann, Varieties of groups, Berlin et al., Springer, 1967, Chapter 5). Do there exist non-passable varieties of groups?\nA. V. Kuznetsov",
  "answer": "Yes, there do (M. I. Anokhin, Moscow Univ. Math. Bull., 51, no. 1 (1996), 48\u201349)."
