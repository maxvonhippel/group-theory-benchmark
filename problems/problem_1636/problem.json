  "problem_text": "Let X be a finite set and f a mapping from the set of subsets of X to the positive integers. Under the requirement that in a group generated by X, every subgroup \u27e8Y \u27e9, Y \u2286 X, be nilpotent of class \u2a7d f(Y ), is it true that the free group Gf relative to this condition is torsion-free?\nA.
