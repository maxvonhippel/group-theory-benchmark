  "problem_text": "Construct examples of residually finite groups which would separate Shunkov\u2019s classes of groups with (a, b)-finiteness condition, (weakly) conjugacy biprimitively finite groups and (weakly) biprimitively finite groups (see, in particular, 6.57). Can one derive such examples from Golod\u2019s construction?\nA. I. Sozutov",
  "answer": "Such examples are constructed (L. Hammoudi, Nil-alg`ebres non-nilpotentes et groupes p\u00b4eriodiques infinis (Doctor Thesis), Strasbourg, 1996; A. V. Rozhkov, Finiteness conditions in groups of automorphisms of trees (Doctor of Sci. Thesis), Krasnoyarsk, 1997; Algebra and Logic, 37, no. 3 (1998), 192\u2013203)."
