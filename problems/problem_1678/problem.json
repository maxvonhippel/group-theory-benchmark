  "problem_text": "In any group G, the cosets of all of its normal subgroups together with the empty set form the block lattice C(G) with respect to inclusion, which, for infinite |G|, is subdirectly irreducible and, for finite |G| \u2a7e 3, is even simple (D. M. Smirnov, A. V. Reibol\u2019d, Algebra and Logic, 23, no. 6 (1984), 459\u2013470). How large is the class of such lattices? Is every finite lattice embeddable in the lattice C(G) for some finite group G?\nD. M. Smirnov",
  "answer": "For each g \u2208 G the filter {x \u2208 C(G) | g \u2208 x} is modular (and even arguesian); the variety generated by the block lattices of groups does not contain all finite lattices (D. M. Smirnov, Siberian Math. J., 33, no. 4 (1992), 663\u2013668)."
