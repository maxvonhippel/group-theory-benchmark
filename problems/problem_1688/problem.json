  "problem_text": "Let p be a prime number. Describe the groups of order p^9 of nilpotency class 2 which contain subgroups X and Y such that |X| = |Y| = p^3 and any non-identity elements x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y do not commute. An answer to this question would yield a description of the semifields of order p^3.\nS. N. Adamov, A. N. Fomin",
