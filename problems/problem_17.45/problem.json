We say that H is strongly pronormal if L^g is conjugate to a subgroup of H in \u27e8H, L^g\u27e9 for every L \u2a7d H and g \u2208 G.\nIn a finite group, is a Hall subgroup with a Sylow tower always strongly pronormal?\nNotice that there exist finite (non-simple) groups with a non-pronormal Hall subgroup. Hall subgroups with a Sylow tower are known to be pronormal.\nE. P. Vdovin, D. O. Revin"
