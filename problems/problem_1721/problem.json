  "answer": "No, given any group G there is a metabelian group M with trivial center such that Out M \u223c= G (R. G\u00a8obel, A. Paras, J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 149, no. 3 (2000) 251\u2013266), and if G is finite or countable then M above can be chosen countable (R. G\u00a8obel, A. Paras, in: Abelian Groups and Modules, Proc. Int. Conf. Dublin, 1998, Birkh\u00a8auser, Basel, 1999, 309\u2013317)."
