  "problem_text": "Let Ld be the homogeneous component of degree d in a free Lie algebra L of rank 2 over the field of order 2. What is the dimension of the fixed point space in Ld for the automorphism of L which interchanges two elements of a free generating set of L ? L. G. Kov\u00b4acs",
  "answer": "It is found; R. M. Bryant and R. St\u00a8ohr (Arch. Math., 67, no. 4 (1996), 281\u2013289) confirmed the conjecture from (M. W. Short, Commun. Algebra, 23, no. 8 (1995), 3051\u20133057)."
