  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite group of order p^a \u00b7 q^b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , where p, q, . . . are distinct primes. Introduce distinct variables x_p, x_q, . . . corresponding to p, q, . . . . Define functions f, \u03c6 from the lattice of subgroups of G to the polynomial ring Z[x_p, x_q, . . .] as follows:\n(1) if H has order p^\u03b1 \u00b7 q^\u03b2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , then f(H) = x_p^\u03b1 \u00b7 x_q^\u03b2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\n(2) for all H \u2a7d G, we have\n\u2211_{K\u2a7dH} \u03c6(K) = f(H).\nThen f(G), \u03c6(G) may be called the order and Eulerian polynomials of G. Substituting p^m, q^m, . . . for x_p, x_q, . . . in these polynomials we get the mth power of the order of G and the number of ordered m-tuples of elements that generate G respectively.\nIt is known that if G is p-solvable, then \u03c6(G) is a product of a polynomial in x_p and a polynomial in the remaining variables. Consequently, if G is solvable, \u03c6(G) is the product of a polynomial in x_p by a polynomial in x_q by . . . . Are the converses of these statements true a) for solvable groups? b) for p-solvable groups?\nG. E. Wall",
  "answer": "Yes, the converses are true: a) for solvable groups (E. Detomi, A. Lucchini, J. London Math. Soc. (2), 70 (2004), 165\u2013181); b) for p-solvable groups (E. Damian, A. Lucchini, Commun. Algebra, 35 (2007), 3451\u20133472)."
