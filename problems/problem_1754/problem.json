  "problem_text": "a) Let V be a variety of groups. Its relatively free group of given rank has a presentation F/N, where F is absolutely free of the same rank and N fully invariant in F. The associated Lie ring L(F/N) has a presentation L/J, where L is the free Lie ring of the same rank and J an ideal of L. Is J always fully invariant in L?\nG. E. Wall",
  "answer": "No, not always; the ideal J is not fully invariant for F/(F^2)^4, that is, for V = B4B2 (D. Groves, J. Algebra, 211, no. 1 (1999), 15\u201325)."
