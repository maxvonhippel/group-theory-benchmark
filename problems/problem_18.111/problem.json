  "problem_text": "Let G be a discrete countable group, given as a central extension 0 \u2192 Z \u2192 G \u2192 Q \u2192 0. Assume that either G is quasi-isometric to Z \u00d7 Q, or that Z \u2192 G is a quasi-isometric embedding. Does that imply that G comes from a bounded cocycle on Q?\nI. Chatterji, G. Mislin"
