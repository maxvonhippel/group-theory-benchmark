  "problem_text": "What are the nonabelian composition factors of a finite nonsoluble group all of whose maximal subgroups have complements?\nNote that finite simple groups with all maximal subgroups having complements are, up to isomorphism, L2(7), L2(11), and L5(2) (V. M. Levchuk, A. G. Likharev, Siberian Math. J., 47, no. 4 (2006), 659\u2013668). The same groups exhaust finite simple groups with Hall maximal subgroups and composition factors of groups with Hall maximal subgroups (N. V. Maslova, Siberian Math. J., 53, no. 5 (2012), 853\u2013861). It is also proved that in a finite group with Hall maximal subgroups all maximal subgroups have complements (N. V. Maslova, D. O. Revin, Siberian Adv. Math., 23, no. 3 (2013), 196\u2013209).\nN. V. Maslova, D. O. Revin"
