  "problem_text": "(N. Aronszajn). Suppose that W(x, y) = 1 in an open subset of G \u00d7 G,\nwhere G is a connected topological group. Must W(x, y) = 1 for all (x, y) \u2208 G \u00d7 G?\nFor locally compact groups the answer is yes.\nJ. Mycielski",
  "answer": "No, not necessarily: for any odd integer n > 1010 there is a connected topological\ngroup such that the identity x^n = 1 holds in some neighborhood of unity, but not\nin the entire group (E. Reznichenko, I. Zyabrev, Preprint, 2024, https://arxiv.org/\nabs/2406.05203)."
