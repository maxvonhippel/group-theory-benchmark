  "problem_text": "Let G = F/R be a pro-p-group with one defining relation, where R is the normal subgroup of a free pro-p-group F generated by a single element r \u2208 F^p[F, F]. a) Suppose that r = t^p for some t \u2208 F; can G contain a Demushkin group as a subgroup? b) Do there exist two pro-p-groups G1 \u2283 G2 with one defining relation, where G1 has elements of finite order, while the subgroup G2 is torsion-free? O. V. Mel\u2019nikov",
  "answer": "a) Yes, it can. b) Yes, they exist. The pro-p-group with presentation \u27e8a, b | [a, b]^p = 1\u27e9 contains the Demushkin group \u27e8x1, . . . , x2g | \u220f_{i=1}^g [x_{2i\u22121}, x_{2i}] = 1\u27e9 for some g > 1. (O. V. Mel\u2019nikov, Letter of February, 28, 1999)."
