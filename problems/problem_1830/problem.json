  "problem_text": "Let \u0393 be a group generated by a finite set S. Assume that there exists a nested sequence F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 of finite subsets of \u0393 such that\n(i) Fk \u0338= Fk+1 for all k \u2a7e 1,\n(ii) \u0393 = \u22c3_{k\u2a7e1} Fk,\n(iii) lim_{k\u2192\u221e} |\u2202Fk|/|Fk| = 0, where, by definition, \u2202Fk = { \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \\ Fk | there exists s \u2208 S such that \u03b3s \u2208 Fk },\nand\n(iv) there exist constants c \u2a7e 0, d \u2a7e 1 such that |Fk| \u2a7d c k^d for all k \u2a7e 1. Does it follow that \u0393 has polynomial growth?\nA. G. Vaillant",
  "answer": "No, not always. These properties are enjoyed by every group of intermediate growth (V. G. Bardakov, Algebra and Logic, 40, no. 1 (2001), 12\u201316)."
