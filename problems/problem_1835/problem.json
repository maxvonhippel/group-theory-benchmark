  "problem_text": "14.49. Is SL3(Z) a factor group of the modular group PSL2(Z)? Since the latter is isomorphic to the free product of two cyclic groups of orders 2 and 3, the question asks if SL3(Z) can be generated by two elements of orders 2 and 3.\nM. Conder",
  "answer": "No, it is not (M. C. Tamburini, P. Zucca, Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur. Rend. Lincei (9) Mat. Appl., 11, no. 1 (2000), 5\u20137; Ya. N. Nuzhin, Math. Notes, 70, no. 1\u20132 (2001), 71\u201378). M. Conder has shown, however, that SL3(Z) has a subgroup of index 57 that is a factor group of the modular group PSL2(Z). Also it has been shown in (M. C. Tamburini, J. S. Wilson, N. Gavioli, J. Algebra, 168 (1994), 353\u2013370) that SLd(Z) is a factor group of the modular group PSL2(Z) for all d \u2a7e 28."
