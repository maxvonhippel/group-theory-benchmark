  "problem_text": "Suppose that H is a non-trivial normal subgroup of a finite group G such that the factor-group G/H is isomorphic to one of the simple groups Ln(q), n \u2a7e 3. Is it true that G has an element whose order is distinct from the order of any element in G/H?\nV. D. Mazurov",
  "answer": "Yes, it is true: for n \u0338= 4 proved in (A. V. Zavarnitsine, Siberian Math. J., 49 (2008), 246\u2013256), and for n = 4 in (M. A. Grechkoseeva, S. V. Skresanov, Siberian Electron. Math. Rep., 17 (2020), 585\u2013589). Editors\u2019 comment: previous claim that it is not true for n = 4 was erroneous."
