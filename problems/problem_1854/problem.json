  "problem_text": "Let H be a proper subgroup of a group G and let elements a, b \u2208 H have distinct prime orders p, q. Suppose that, for every g \u2208 G \\ H, the subgroup \u27e8a, bg\u27e9 is a finite Frobenius group with complement of order pq. Does the subgroup generated by the union of the kernels of all Frobenius subgroups of G with complement \u27e8a\u27e9 intersect \u27e8a\u27e9 trivially? The case where all groups \u27e8a, bg\u27e9, g \u2208 G, are finite is of special interest.\nV. P. Shunkov",
  "answer": "No, in general case not necessarily.\nAs a counter-example one can take G = \u27e8x, y, z, a, b | x7 = y7 = [x, y, y] = [x, y, x] = a3 = b2 = [a, b] = 1, xa = x2, ya = y2, xb = x\u22121, yb = y\u22121\u27e9 with H = \u27e8a, b\u27e9. Analogous examples exist also for p = 2 and every odd prime q (A. I. Sozutov, Letter of 2002)."
