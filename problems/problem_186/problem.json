  "problem_text": "Describe the finite groups generated by a conjugacy class D of involutions which satisfies the following property: if a, b \u2208 D and |ab| = 4, then [a, b] \u2208 D. This condition is satisfied, for example, in the case where D is a conjugacy class of involutions of a known finite simple group such that \u27e8C_D(a)\u27e9 is a 2-group for every a \u2208 D.\nA. A.
