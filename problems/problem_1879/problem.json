  "problem_text": "15.63. b) Let Fn be the free group of finite rank n on the free generators x1, . . . , xn. An element u \u2208 Fn is called positive if u belongs to the semigroup generated by the xi. An element u \u2208 Fn is called potentially positive if \u03b1(u) is positive for some automorphism \u03b1 of Fn. Finally, u \u2208 Fn is called stably potentially positive if it is potentially positive as an element of Fm for some m \u2a7e n. Are there stably potentially positive elements that are not potentially positive? A. G. Myasnikov, V. E. Shpilrain",
  "answer": "No, there are none (A. Clark, R. Goldstein, Commun. Algebra, 33, no. 11 (2005), 4097\u20134104)."
