FORMALIZATION ATTEMPT SUMMARY
Kourovka Notebook Problem 19.110
================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
(G. M. Bergman and A. Magidin). Do there exist varieties of groups in which the
relatively free group of rank 2 is finite, and the relatively free group of rank 3
is infinite?
P. Zusmanovich

MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT:
=====================

1. VARIETY OF GROUPS: A variety of groups V is a class of groups closed under
   subgroups, quotients, and direct products. Equivalently, by Birkhoff's theorem,
   it is the class of all groups satisfying a given set of identities (laws).

2. RELATIVELY FREE GROUP: For a variety V and a natural number n, the relatively
   free group F_n(V) is the "freest" group on n generators within V. It is the
   quotient of the (absolutely) free group F_n by the verbal subgroup determined
   by the identities defining V.

3. THE QUESTION: Can there exist a variety V such that:
   - F_2(V) is finite (every 2-generated group in V has bounded order)
   - F_3(V) is infinite (there exist arbitrarily large 3-generated groups in V)

WHY THIS PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT:
==============================

1. CROSS VARIETIES: If V is generated by a finite group G (a "Cross variety"),
   then all F_n(V) are finite. This doesn't help construct the desired example.

2. BURNSIDE VARIETIES: In the variety B_n of all groups of exponent n:
   - For n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: All F_m(B_n) are finite for all m
   - For n >= 665 (odd): F_m(B_n) is infinite for all m >= 2
   Neither case gives the threshold behavior at rank 3.

3. NEAR CROSS VARIETIES: These are varieties that are not Cross but all proper
   subvarieties are Cross. They could potentially exhibit threshold behavior,
   but no example matching the problem has been found.

4. NO COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH: GAP cannot directly construct arbitrary varieties
   or verify infiniteness of relatively free groups. The problem requires either:
   - An explicit construction of such a variety (if the answer is YES)
   - A general proof that no such variety exists (if the answer is NO)

WHY FORMALIZATION WAS NOT POSSIBLE:
===================================

1. MISSING MATHLIB INFRASTRUCTURE: While Lean's mathlib has:
   - Free groups (FreeGroup.Basic)
   - Presented groups (quotients by relations)
   - Basic group theory

   It does NOT have:
   - Varieties of groups (equationally defined classes)
   - Verbal subgroups
   - Relatively free groups in varieties
   - The HSP theorem (Birkhoff's characterization of varieties)

2. FUNDAMENTAL OPEN PROBLEM: Even with the infrastructure, this is an open
   problem in the Kourovka Notebook. A formalization would require either:
   - Constructing a specific variety with the desired property (if YES)
   - Proving a general impossibility theorem (if NO)
   Neither is currently known.

3. SCOPE OF REQUIRED FORMALIZATION: To even STATE the problem formally would
   require building substantial infrastructure:
   - Definition of variety of groups
   - Definition of verbal subgroups
   - Construction of relatively free groups
   - Cardinality arguments
   This goes well beyond what can be reasonably achieved without first
   developing the underlying theory.

LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTS:
==========================

1. The problem appears in Kourovka Notebook Edition 19, submitted by
   G. M. Bergman and A. Magidin.

2. Bergman and Magidin collaborated on work about dominions in varieties of
   groups (Magidin's PhD thesis, 1998, under Bergman).

3. No solution or progress on this specific problem was found in:
   - The 21st edition of the Kourovka Notebook (2026)
   - Published literature on varieties of groups
   - Work by Hanna Neumann on problems about varieties

4. Related work:
   - L.G. Kovacs: "Varieties and Finite Groups" (1967)
   - Hanna Neumann: "Varieties of Groups" (book)
   - Kovacs & Newman: "Hanna Neumann's Problems on Varieties of Groups"

COMPUTATIONAL EXPLORATION:
==========================

GAP was used to explore:
1. Free Burnside groups of various ranks and exponents
2. Properties of small groups in the SmallGroups library

None of these explorations yielded insight into the problem because:
- Burnside varieties don't exhibit the threshold behavior
- Cross varieties (generated by finite groups) are always locally finite
- The problem requires constructing or ruling out exotic varieties

CONCLUSION:
===========

This is a deep open problem in the theory of varieties of groups. The question
asks about a subtle threshold phenomenon where finiteness transitions from
rank 2 to rank 3. Such behavior, if it exists, would require a variety with
very specific structural properties not found in familiar examples (Burnside
varieties, abelian varieties, nilpotent varieties, etc.).

A meaningful formalization is not currently possible due to:
1. Missing foundational infrastructure in mathlib
2. The open nature of the problem itself
3. Lack of known candidate varieties to analyze

The problem remains an interesting open question in universal algebra and
group theory.

POTENTIAL APPROACHES FOR FUTURE WORK:
=====================================

1. Study "near Cross varieties" and their properties regarding finiteness
   thresholds at different ranks.

2. Investigate whether the question has been addressed in the broader context
   of universal algebra (for other algebraic structures, not just groups).

3. Develop the theory of varieties of groups in Lean/mathlib, which would be
   valuable independently of this specific problem.

4. Search for obstructions: are there general theorems about varieties that
   would rule out such threshold behavior?
