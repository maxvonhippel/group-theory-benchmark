  "problem_text": "A subgroup H of a group G is called pronormal if H and Hg are conjugate in \u27e8H, Hg\u27e9 for every g \u2208 G. A subgroup H of a group G is called abnormal if g \u2208 \u27e8H, Hg\u27e9 for every g \u2208 G. Does there exist an infinite group that does not contain nontrivial proper pronormal subgroups? The question is equivalent to the following: does there exist an infinite simple group that does not contain proper abnormal subgroups? D. O. Revin",
