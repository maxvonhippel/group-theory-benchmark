Suppose that for every integer n > 0 the\ngroup G has a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible complex linear representation\nof dimension n. (Note that G = SL(2, Q) has these properties, by a theorem of Borel\u2013\nTits (Ann. Math., 97 (1973), 499\u2013571).) Is it true that G has a normal subgroup N\nsuch that G/N is isomorphic to SL(2, Q)?\nJ.-P. Serre"
