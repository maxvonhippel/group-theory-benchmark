  "problem_text": "8.50. At a conference in Oberwolfach in 1979 I exhibited a finitely generated soluble group G (of derived length 3) and a non-zero cyclic ZG-module V such that V \u223c= V \u2295 V. Can this be done with G metabelian? I conjecture that it cannot. For background of this problem and for details of the construction see (P. M. Neumann, in: Groups\u2013Korea, Pusan, 1988 (Lect. Notes Math., 1398), Springer, Berlin, 1989, 124\u2013139). P. M. Neumann"
