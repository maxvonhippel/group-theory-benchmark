  "problem_text": "Do there exist uncountably many infinite 2-groups that are quotients of the group \u27e8 x, y | x2 = y4 = (xy)8 = 1 \u27e9? There certainly exists one, namely the subgroup of finite index in Grigorchuk\u2019s first group generated by b and ad; see (R. I. Grigorchuk, Functional Anal. Appl., 14 (1980), 41\u201343). J. Wiegold",
  "answer": "Yes, there do (R. I. Grigorchuk, Algebra Discrete Math., 2009, no. 4 (2009), 78\u201396 (subm. 25 November 2009); A. Minasyan, A. Yu. Olshanskii, D. Sonkin, Groups Geom. Dynam., 3, no. 3 (2009) 423\u2013452 (subm. 21 April 2008))."
