  "problem_text": "The normal covering number of the symmetric group S_n of degree n is the minimum number \u03b3(S_n) of proper subgroups H_1, . . . , H_{\u03b3(S_n)} of S_n such that every element of S_n is conjugate to an element of H_i, for some i = 1, . . . , \u03b3(S_n). Write n = p_1^{\u03b11} \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 p_r^{\u03b1r} for primes p_1 < \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 < p_r and positive integers \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1r.\nConjecture:\n\u03b3(S_n) =\n{\n(n/2)(1 - 1/p_1) if r = 1 and \u03b11 = 1;\n(n/2)(1 - 1/p_1) + 1 if r = 1 and \u03b11 \u2a7e 2;\n(n/2)(1 - 1/p_1)(1 - 1/p_2) + 1 if r = 2 and \u03b11 + \u03b12 = 2;\n(n/2)(1 - 1/p_1)(1 - 1/p_2) + 2 if r \u2a7e 2 and \u03b11 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \u03b1r \u2a7e 3\n}\nThis is the strongest form of the conjecture. We would be also interested in a proof that this holds for n sufficiently large.\nThe result for r \u2a7d 2, which includes the first three cases above, is proved for n odd (D. Bubboloni, C. E. Praeger, J. Combin. Theory (A), 118 (2011), 2000\u20132024). When r \u2a7e 3 we know that c n \u2a7d \u03b3(S_n) \u2a7d (2/3)n for some positive constant c (D. Bubboloni, C. E. Praeger, P. Spiga, J. Algebra, 390 (2013) 199\u2013215). We showed that the conjectured value for \u03b3(S_n) is an upper bound, by constructing a normal covering for S_n with this number of conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups, and gave further evidence for the truth of the conjecture in other cases (D. Bubboloni, C. E. Praeger, P. Spiga, Int. J. Group Theory, 3, no. 2 (2014), 57\u201375).\nD. Bubboloni, C. E. Praeger, P. Spiga",
