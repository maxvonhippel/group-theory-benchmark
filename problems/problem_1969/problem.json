  "problem_text": "Is every finite simple group generated by two elements of prime-power orders m, n? (Here numbers m, n may depend on the group.) The work of many authors shows that it remains to verify this property for a small number of finite simple groups.\nJ. Krempa",
  "answer": "Yes, it is (mod CFSG); moreover, every finite simple group is generated by an involution and an element of prime order (C. S. H. King, J. Algebra, 478 (2017), 153\u2013173)."
