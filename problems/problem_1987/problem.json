A finite graph is said to be integral if all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix are integers.\na) Let G be a finite group generated by a normal subset R consisting of involutions. Is it true that the Cayley graph Cay(G, R) is integral?\nb) Let An be the alternating group of degree n, let S = {(123), (124), . . . , (12n)} and R = S \u222a S\u22121. Is it true that the Cayley graph Cay(An, R) is integral?\nD. V. Lytkina",
  "answer": "a) Yes, it is true (D. O. Revin, Letter of 21 April 2018; see also the reference for part (b) below; A. Abdollahi, Letter of 3 May 2018). Both proofs suggested are based on character theory; here is the second one. It suffices to show that the eigenvalues of Cay(G, R) are rational, since the eigenvalues of a simple graph are algebraic integers. It is known that every eigenvalue of Cay(G, R) has the form \u03b8\u03c7 = 1/\u03c7(1) \u2211_{r\u2208R} \u03c7(r) for some complex irreducible character \u03c7 of G (implicit on pages 175\u2013177 in P. Diaconis, M. Shahshahani, Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie Verw. Gebiete, 57 (1981), 159\u2013179, see also Theorem 9 in M. R. Murty, J. Ramanujan Math. Soc., 18, no. 1 (2003) 1\u201320). Since the value of any complex character on an involution is an integer, it follows that \u03b8\u03c7 is rational.\nb) Yes, it is true (W. Guo, D. V. Lytkina, V. D. Mazurov, D. O. Revin, Algebra Logic, 58, no. 4 (2019), 297\u2013305)."
