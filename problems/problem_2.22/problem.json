  "problem_text": "a) An abstract group-theoretic property \u03a3 is said to be radical (in our sense) if, in any group G, the subgroup \u03a3(G) generated by all normal \u03a3-subgroups is a \u03a3-subgroup itself (called the \u03a3-radical of G). A radical property \u03a3 is said to be strongly radical if, for any group G, the factor-group G/\u03a3(G) contains no non-trivial normal \u03a3-subgroups. Is the property RN radical? strongly radical?\nSh. S. Kemkhadze"
