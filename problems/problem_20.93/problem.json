Are the following well-known results of the theory of finite groups true in the class of (periodic) Shunkov groups?\n\na) The Baer\u2013Suzuki theorem (see 11.11 in Archive).\n\nb) The Burnside\u2013Brauer\u2013Suzuki theorem on the existence of a normal section of order 2 in a group with a non-trivial Sylow 2-subgroup containing only one involution (see 4.75).\n\nc) Glauberman\u2019s Z\u2217-theorem (see 10.62 and Archive, 11.13).\n\nA.
