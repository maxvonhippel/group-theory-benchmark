A topological group is\ncalled Raikov complete if its two-sided uniform structure is complete. It is known\nthat a finite direct product of Raikov complete minimal topological groups is again\nminimal. Is it true that an arbitrary Cartesian product of Raikov complete minimal\ntopological groups remains minimal?\nIt is known that an arbitrary Cartesian product of centre-free minimal topological\ngroups is minimal (M. Megrelishvili, Topology Appl., 62, no. 1 (1995), 1\u201319). D. Peng"
