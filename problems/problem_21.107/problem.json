A sequence {Fn} of pairwise disjoint finite subsets of a topological group is\ncalled expansive if for every open subset U there is a number m such that Fn \u2229U \u0338= \u2205\nfor all n > m. Suppose that a countable group G can be partitioned into countably\nmany dense subsets. Is it true that in G there exists an expansive sequence? Cf. 15.80.\nI. V. Protasov"
