Bergman, Pacific J. Math., 274 (2015) 451\u2013495).\n(a) Infinite finitely generated groups of finite exponent.\n(b) For an infinite set X, the group of those permutations of X that move only finitely many elements.\nIt is known that no group of permutations containing an element with exactly one infinite orbit can be written as an image of such an ultraproduct (ibid.).\nG.
