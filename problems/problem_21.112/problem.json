  "problem_text": "A nonempty class X of finite groups is said to be complete if X is closed under taking subgroups, homomorphic images, and extensions. The symmetric boundary of a complete class X other than the class of all finite groups is defined as the largest integer n such that Sn \u2208X. Every positive integer n \u0338= 3 coincides with the symmetric boundary of some complete class. It is proved (mod CFSG, D. O. Revin, Algebra i Analiz, 37, no. 1 (2025), 141\u2013176 (Russian)) that, for every complete class X, there exists a nonnegative integer m with the following property: for every finite group G and each conjugacy class D of G, if every m elements of D generate a subgroup belonging to X, then \u27e8D\u27e9\u2208X. The smallest such m is called the Baer\u2013Suzuki width of X denoted by BS(X). It is also proved (mod CFSG, ibid.) that, for a complete class X of symmetric boundary n, the value of BS(X) is at least n and is bounded above in terms of n. For every positive integer n \u0338= 3, let f+(n) and f\u2212(n) be respectively the maximum and the minimum of BS(X), where X runs over all complete classes of symmetric boundary n.\n(a) Find f+(n) for n = 4, 5, 6.\nIt is known that f+(1) = 2, f+(2) = 3, and f+(n) = 2(n \u22121) for n \u2a7e7.\n(b) Is it true that f\u2212(n) = n for all n \u0338= 3? This is known to be true for n = 1, 2, 4.\nD. O. Revin, N. Y. Yang"
