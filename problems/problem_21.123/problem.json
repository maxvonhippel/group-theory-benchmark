  "problem_text": "Is it true that the extension of the A. Agrachev\u2013R. Gamkrelidze construction of groups from pre-Lie rings in (J. Soviet Math., 17 (1981), 1650\u20131675) suggested in Definition 66 of (A. Smoktunowicz, J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 229, no. 12 (2025), 108128) produces groups from pre-Lie rings?\nIf this extended construction does give a group, then it also gives a brace, and so an affirmative answer to this question would have consequences for the theory of set-theoretic solutions of the Yang\u2013Baxter equation and for the theory of braces.\nA. Smoktunowicz"
