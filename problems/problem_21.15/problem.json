  "problem_text": "Suppose B is a subgroup of the symmetric group S\u2126 on an infinite set \u2126. Will the amalgamated free product S\u2126 \u2217B S\u2126 of two copies of S\u2126 with amalgamation of B be embeddable in S\u2126? This is a weakened form of the group case of Question 4.4 in (G. M. Bergman, Indag. Math., 18 (2007), 349\u2013403). It is known that S\u2126 \u2217B S\u2126 need not be so embeddable by a map respecting B (Algebra Number Theory, 3 (2009), 847\u2013879, \u00a7 10).
