  "problem_text": "If X is a class of groups, let H(X) denote the class of homomorphic images of groups in X, let S(X) denote the class of groups isomorphic to subgroups of groups in X, let P(X) denote the class of groups isomorphic to (unrestricted) direct products of families of groups in X, and let Pf(X) denote the class of groups isomorphic to direct products of finite families of groups in X. By Birkhoff\u2019s theorem, H(S(P(X))) is the variety of groups generated by X. If M is a class of metabelian groups, must H(S(Pf(M))) \u2286 S(H(P(S(M))))? This is Question 27 in (G. M. Bergman, Algebra Universalis, 26 (1989), 267\u2013283). G. M. Bergman"
