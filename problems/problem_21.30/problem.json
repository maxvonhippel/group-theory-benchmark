  "problem_text": "(Well-known question). A discrete group G is said to have the Haagerup property (also known as Gromov\u2019s a-T-menability property) if there exists a metrically proper isometric action of G on a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space. Are all 1-relator groups Haagerup groups? J. O. Button"
