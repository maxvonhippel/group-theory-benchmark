Does there exist a finitely presented group G such that G \u223c= G \u00d7 H for some non-trivial group H?\nThe first finitely generated example was constructed in (J. M. Tyrer Jones, J. Austral. Math. Soc., 17 (1974), 174\u2013196). A finitely presented group that surjects onto its own direct square was constructed in (G. Baumslag, C. F. Miller, III, Bull. London Math. Soc., 20, no. 3 (1988), 239\u2013244).\nF. Fournier-Facio"
