  "problem_text": "Let G be a finite soluble group with triality, which means that G admits a group of automorphisms S isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree 3 given by the presentation S = \u27e8\u03c3, \u03c1 | \u03c3^2 = \u03c1^3 = 1; \u03c3\u03c1\u03c3 = \u03c1^2\u27e9 such that m \u00b7 m^\u03c1 \u00b7 m^{\u03c1^2} = 1 for all m in the set of commutators M(G) := {[g, \u03c3] | g \u2208 G}.\nSuppose in addition that G = [G, S], the group G is generated by d elements of M(G) and their images under S, and x^n = 1 for all x \u2208 M(G). Is it true that the Fitting height of G is bounded in terms of d and n?\nAn affirmative answer would provide a reduction of the analogue of the Restricted Burnside Problem for Moufang loops to the nilpotent case.\nA.
