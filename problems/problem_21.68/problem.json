A finite group G is said to be semi-abelian if it has a sequence of subgroups 1 = G0 \u2a7d G1 \u2a7d \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2a7d Gn = G such that for every i the subgroup Gi+1 is isomorphic to a quotient of a semidirect product Ai \u22ca Gi for some abelian group Ai.\nConjecture: Semi-abelian finite groups are monomial.\nM.
