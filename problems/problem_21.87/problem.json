  "problem_text": "21.87. Assume that a finite group G has a family of d-generator subgroups whose indices have no common divisor. Is it true that G can be generated by d+1 elements? The answer is positive if G is solvable (L. G. Kov\u00b4acs, H.-S. Sim, Indag. Math., 2 (1991), 229\u2013232). For an arbitrary finite group G it is proved that G can be generated by d + 2 elements (A. Lucchini, Commun. Algebra, 28, no. 4 (2000), 1875\u20131880). A. Lucchini"
