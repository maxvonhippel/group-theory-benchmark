  "problem_text": "It is known that if M is a variety (quasivariety, pseudovariety) of groups, then the class IM of all quasigroups that are isotopic to groups in M is also a variety (quasivariety, pseudovariety), and IM is finitely based if and only if M is finitely based. Is it true that if M is generated by a single finite group then IM is generated by a single finite quasigroup?\nA. A. Gvaramiya"
