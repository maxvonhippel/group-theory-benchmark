FORMALIZATION ATTEMPT SUMMARY
Problem: Kourovka Notebook 9.9 (R.I. Grigorchuk)
========================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Does there exist a finitely generated group which is not nilpotent-by-finite
and whose growth function has as a majorant a function of the form c^{sqrt(n)}
where c is a constant greater than 1?

TRANSLATION:
The problem asks whether there exists a finitely generated group G such that:
1. G does not have a nilpotent subgroup of finite index
2. The growth function gamma_G(n) satisfies gamma_G(n) <= c^{sqrt(n)} for some c > 1

This is equivalent to asking: Is there a "gap" between polynomial growth
(characterizing virtually nilpotent groups by Gromov's theorem) and growth
of order e^{sqrt(n)}?

========================================================================
WHY FORMALIZATION IS INFEASIBLE:
========================================================================

1. GROWTH FUNCTION INFRASTRUCTURE MISSING IN MATHLIB
   - Mathlib does not have formalized definitions of word growth functions
     for finitely generated groups
   - The Cayley graph construction and ball counting are not available
   - Asymptotic comparison of growth functions (big-O, little-o notation
     for group growth) is not developed in the group theory context

2. GEOMETRIC GROUP THEORY NOT DEVELOPED
   - The problem lies squarely in geometric group theory
   - Key concepts missing include:
     * Word metrics on groups
     * Growth functions gamma_G(n) = |B_S(n)| for generating set S
     * Equivalence of growth functions under different generating sets
     * The intermediate growth classification

3. EXAMPLES REQUIRE INFINITE CONSTRUCTIONS
   - The Grigorchuk group (the main example in this area) is an infinite
     finitely generated group defined via automorphisms of a binary rooted tree
   - Such constructions require substantial infrastructure not in mathlib:
     * Self-similar groups
     * Automaton groups
     * Tree automorphism groups

4. THE PROBLEM IS OPEN
   - This is the famous "Gap Conjecture" in geometric group theory
   - The conjecture states that no such group exists (answer is "No")
   - It remains unproven in full generality
   - Partial results exist for specific classes:
     * Residually nilpotent groups: Gap conjecture holds (Grigorchuk)
     * Residually solvable groups: Gap conjecture holds (recent work)
     * Linear groups: Have polynomial or exponential growth (dichotomy)
     * Solvable groups: Have polynomial or exponential growth (dichotomy)

========================================================================
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:
========================================================================

KEY THEOREMS:
- Gromov's Theorem (1981): A finitely generated group has polynomial growth
  if and only if it is virtually nilpotent.

- Grigorchuk (1984): There exist finitely generated groups of intermediate
  growth (between polynomial and exponential).

- The Grigorchuk group has growth ~e^{n^{0.767}} (Erschler-Zheng 2020),
  which is much faster than e^{sqrt(n)} = e^{n^{0.5}}.

THE GAP CONJECTURE:
If a finitely generated group G satisfies gamma_G(n) < e^{sqrt(n)},
then G is virtually nilpotent (has polynomial growth).

Equivalently: There is no group with growth strictly between polynomial
and e^{sqrt(n)}.

CURRENT STATUS:
- All known groups of intermediate growth have growth at least e^{sqrt(n)}
- The gap conjecture has been verified for many important classes
- The full conjecture remains open

========================================================================
WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR FORMALIZATION:
========================================================================

1. Define: Finitely generated groups with explicit generating sets
2. Define: Word length function and word metric
3. Define: Growth function gamma(n) = number of elements of word length <= n
4. Prove: Growth function class is independent of generating set
5. Define: Nilpotent-by-finite (virtually nilpotent) groups
6. Formalize: Gromov's theorem (polynomial growth iff virtually nilpotent)
7. Define: The intermediate growth regime
8. State: The Gap Conjecture as the negation of the existence statement

This would require a substantial development project in geometric group
theory, estimated at hundreds of lines of Lean code just for the basic
infrastructure.
