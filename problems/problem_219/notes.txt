PROBLEM ANALYSIS
================

Kourovka Notebook Problem 9.9 (posed by R.I. Grigorchuk) asks:

"Does there exist a finitely generated group which is not nilpotent-by-finite
and whose growth function has as a majorant a function of the form c^sqrt(n)
where c is a constant greater than 1?"

This is the famous "Gap Conjecture" in geometric group theory. The conjecture
is that the answer is NO - there is no such group, meaning there is a "gap"
in possible growth rates between polynomial growth (characterizing virtually
nilpotent groups) and e^{sqrt(n)}.

PROBLEM STATUS: OPEN
====================

The Gap Conjecture remains one of the major open problems in geometric group
theory. Key facts:

1. Gromov's Theorem (1981): Polynomial growth iff virtually nilpotent

2. Grigorchuk's Group (1984): First example of intermediate growth, with
   growth ~e^{n^{0.767}} >> e^{sqrt(n)}

3. All known intermediate growth groups have growth at least e^{sqrt(n)}

4. Gap Conjecture verified for:
   - Residually nilpotent groups
   - Residually solvable groups
   - Linear groups (polynomial/exponential dichotomy)
   - Solvable groups (polynomial/exponential dichotomy)

5. Full conjecture remains unproven

WHY FORMALIZATION FAILED
========================

1. Mathlib lacks infrastructure for group growth functions:
   - No word metric on finitely generated groups
   - No growth function definitions
   - No Cayley graph theory

2. Geometric group theory is not developed in mathlib

3. The Grigorchuk group construction (tree automorphisms, self-similar
   groups) is not available in mathlib

4. The problem is OPEN - there is no proof or counterexample to formalize

GAP INVESTIGATION
=================

GAP cannot help with this problem because:
- It concerns infinite finitely generated groups
- Growth functions are asymptotic/analytical properties
- The Grigorchuk group is not in the SmallGroups library
- The automgrp package (for automaton groups) was not available

CONCLUSION
==========

This problem cannot be resolved computationally or through formalization.
It is a deep open problem in geometric group theory requiring new mathematical
techniques for resolution. The answer is conjectured to be "No" (Gap
Conjecture), but this remains unproven.
