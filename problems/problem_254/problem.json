  "problem_text": "Prove or disprove the conjecture of P. Cameron (Bull. London Math. Soc., 13, no. 1 (1981), 1\u201322): if G is a finite primitive permutation group of subrank m, then either the rank of G is bounded by a function of m or the order of a point stabilizer is at most m. The subrank of a transitive permutation group is defined to be the maximum rank of the transitive constituents of a point stabilizer.\nA. N. Fomin"
