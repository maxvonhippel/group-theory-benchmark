  "problem_text": "A class of groups is called a direct variety if it is closed under taking sub-groups, factor-groups, and direct products (Yu. M. Gorchakov, Groups with Finite Classes of Conjugate Elements, Moscow, Nauka, 1978 (Russian)). It is obvious that the class of FC-groups is a direct variety. P. Hall (J. London Math. Soc., 34, no. 3 (1959), 289\u2013304) showed that the class of finite groups and the class of abelian groups taken together do not generate the class of FC-groups as a direct variety, and it was shown in (L. A. Kurdachenko, Ukrain. Math. J., 39, no. 3 (1987), 255\u2013259) that the direct variety of FC-groups is also not generated by the class of groups with finite derived subgroups. Is the direct variety of FC-groups generated by the class of groups with finite derived subgroups together with the class of FC-groups having quasicyclic derived subgroups?\nL. A. Kurdachenko"
