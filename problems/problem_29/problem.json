Does there exist a finitely axiomatizable variety\n(3) of Lie rings\n(i) whose I-theory is non-decidable?\nRemark: it is not difficult to find a recursively axiomatizable variety of semigroups with identity whose I-theory is non-recursive (see also A. I. Mal\u2019cev, Mat. Sbornik, 69, no. 1 (1966), 3\u201312 (Russian)).\nA. I. Mal\u2019cev"
