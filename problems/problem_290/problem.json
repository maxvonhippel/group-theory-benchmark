  "problem_text": "Let R and S be associative rings with identity such that 2 is invertible in S. Let \u039bI : GLn(R) \u2192 GLn(R/I) be the homomorphism corresponding to an ideal I of R and let En(R) be the subgroup of GLn(R) generated by elementary transvections tij(x). Let aij = tij(1)tji(\u22121)tij(1), let the bar denote images in the factor-group of GLn(R) by the centre and let PG = G for G \u2a7d GLn(R). A homomorphism \u039b: En(R) \u2192 GL(W) = GLm(S) is called standard if Sm = P \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 P \u2295 Q (a direct sum of S-modules in which there are n summands P) and \u039bx = g\u22121\u03c4(\u03b4\u2217(x)f + (t\u03b4\u2217(x)\u03bd)\u22121(1 \u2212 f))g, x \u2208 En(R), where \u03b4\u2217: GLn(R) \u2192 GLn(End P) is the homomorphism induced by a ring homomorphism \u03b4 : R \u2192 End P taking identity to identity, g is an isomorphism of the module W onto Sm, \u03c4 : GLn(End P) \u2192 GL(gW) is an embedding, f is a central idempotent of \u03b4R, t denotes transposition and \u03bd is an antiisomorphism of \u03b4R. Let n \u2a7e 3, m \u2a7e 2. One can show that the homomorphism \u039b0 : PEn(R) \u2192 GL(W) = GLm(S) is induced by a standard homomorphism \u039b if \u039b0aij = g\u22121\u03c4(a\u2217ij)g for some g and \u03c4 and for any i \u2260 j where a\u2217ij denotes the matrix obtained from aij by replacing 0 and 1 from R by 0 and 1 from End P. Find (at least in particular cases) the form of a homomorphism \u039b0 that does not satisfy the last condition. V. M. Petechuk"
