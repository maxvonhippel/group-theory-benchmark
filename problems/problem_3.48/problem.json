  "problem_text": "It can be shown that hereditary radicals form a semigroup with respect to taking the products of classes. It is an interesting problem to find all indecomposable elements of this semigroup. In particular, we point out the problem of finding all indecomposable radicals contained in the class of locally finite p-groups.\nB. I. Plotkin"
