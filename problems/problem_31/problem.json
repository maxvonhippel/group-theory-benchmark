Prove or refute the following conjecture: If the marginal subgroup\nv\u2217G has finite index m in G, then the order of vG is finite and divides a power of m.\nEditors\u2019 comment: There are examples when |vG| does not divide a power of m\n(Yu. G. Kleiman, Trans. Moscow Math. Soc., 1983, no. 2, 63\u2013110), but the question\nof finiteness remains open.\nYu. I. Merzlyakov"
