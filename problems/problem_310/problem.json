  "problem_text": "10.67. The class LNMp of locally nilpotent groups admitting a splitting automorphism of prime order p (for definition see 10.59) is a variety of groups with operators (E. I. Khukhro, Math. USSR Sbornik, 58 (1987), 119\u2013126). Is it true that\nLNMp = (Nc(p) \u2229 LNMp) \u2228 (Bp \u2229 LNMp)\nwhere Nc(p) is the variety of nilpotent groups of some p-bounded class c(p) and Bp is the variety of groups of exponent p?\nE. I.
