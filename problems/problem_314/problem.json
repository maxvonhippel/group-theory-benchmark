  "problem_text": "10.74. Suppose that a group G contains an element a of prime order such that its centralizer CG(a) is finite and all subgroups \u27e8a, ag\u27e9, g \u2208 G, are finite and almost all of them are soluble. Is G locally finite? This problem is closely connected with 6.56. The question was solved in the positive for a number of very important partial cases by the author (Abstracts on Group Theory of the Mal\u2019cev Int. Conf. on Algebra, Novosibirsk, 1989, p. 145 (Russian)).\nV. P. Shunkov"
