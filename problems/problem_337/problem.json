  "problem_text": "11.30. Is it true that the rank of a torsion-free soluble group is equal to the rank of any of its subgroups of finite index? The answer is affirmative for groups having a rational series (D. I. Zaitsev, in: Groups with restrictions on subgroups, Naukova dumka, Kiev, 1971, 115\u2013130 (Russian)). We note also that every torsion-free soluble group of finite rank contains a subgroup of finite index which has a rational series.\nD. I. Zaitsev"
