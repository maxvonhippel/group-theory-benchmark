A t-(v, k, \u03bb) design D = (X, B) contains a set X of v points and a set B of k-element subsets of X called blocks such that each t-element subset of X is contained in \u03bb blocks. Prove that there are no nontrivial block-transitive 6-designs. (We have shown that there are no nontrivial block-transitive 8-designs and there are certainly some block-transitive, even flag-transitive, 5-designs.)\nComment of 2009: In (Finite Geometry and Combinatorics (Deinze 1992), Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993, 103\u2013119) we showed that a block-transitive group G on a nontrivial 6-design is either an affine group AGL(d, 2) or is between PSL(2, q) and P\u0393L(2, q); in (M. Huber, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 117, no. 2 (2010), 196\u2013203) it is shown that for the case \u03bb = 1 the group G may only be P\u0393L(2, pe), where p is 2 or 3 and e is an odd prime power. Comment of 2013: In the case \u03bb = 1 there are no block-transitive 7-designs (M. Huber, Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 12, no. 1 (2010), 123\u2013132). Comment of 2021: There are no nontrivial 6-designs with k \u2a7d104 in the case where the automorphism group is almost simple (Q. Tan, W. Liu, J. Chen, Algebra Colloq., 21, no. 2 (2014), 231\u2013234).\nP. J. Cameron, C. E. Praeger"
