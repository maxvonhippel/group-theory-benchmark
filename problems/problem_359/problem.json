  "problem_text": "11.62. Describe the groups over which any equation is soluble. In particular, is it true that this class of groups coincides with the class of torsion-free groups? It is easy to see that a group, over which every equation is soluble, is torsion-free. On the other hand, S. D. Brodski\u02d8\u0131 (Siberian Math. J., 25, no. 2 (1984), 235\u2013251) showed that any equation is soluble over a locally indicable group.\nD. I. Moldavanski\u02d8\u0131"
