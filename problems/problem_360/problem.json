  "problem_text": "11.63. Suppose that G is a one-relator group containing non-trivial elements of finite order and N is a subgroup of G generated by all elements of finite order. Is it true that any subgroup of G that intersects N trivially is a free group? One can show that the answer is affirmative in the cases where G/N has non-trivial centre or satisfies a non-trivial identity.\nD. I. Moldavanski\u02d8\u0131"
