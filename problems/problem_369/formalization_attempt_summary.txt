FORMALIZATION ATTEMPT SUMMARY
Kourovka Notebook Problem (Well-known problem / Problem 369)
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Is the group of collineations of a finite non-Desarguesian projective plane
defined over a semifield soluble? (The hypothesis on the plane means that the
corresponding regular set, see Archive, 10.48, is closed under addition.)

Posed by: N. D. Podufalov

================================================================================
STATUS: OPEN PROBLEM - COULD NOT BE FORMALIZED
================================================================================

REASON FOR INABILITY TO FORMALIZE:
---------------------------------

This problem cannot be meaningfully formalized in Lean 4 / Mathlib for the
following interconnected reasons:

1. MISSING FOUNDATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

   The problem requires the following mathematical objects that are not
   available in Mathlib:

   a) Projective Planes: While Mathlib has some incidence geometry, it lacks
      the specific theory of finite projective planes, including:
      - The Lenz-Barlotti classification
      - Coordinatization by ternary rings
      - The distinction between Desarguesian and non-Desarguesian planes

   b) Semifields: The algebraic structure of a semifield (a division ring that
      may lack associativity of multiplication) is not defined in Mathlib.
      Semifields are strictly weaker than division rings but stronger than
      near-rings.

   c) Regular Sets: The problem references "regular sets" which are specific
      geometric configurations used to coordinatize translation planes. This
      is specialized incidence geometry not in Mathlib.

   d) Collineation Groups: The automorphism group of a projective plane
      (collineation group) requires the plane structure to be defined first.

2. COMPLEXITY OF THE MATHEMATICAL SETTING

   The problem sits at the intersection of:
   - Abstract algebra (semifields, group theory)
   - Incidence geometry (projective planes, collineations)
   - Finite geometry (finiteness conditions, order of planes)

   Formalizing even the problem STATEMENT would require hundreds of lines
   of foundational definitions before the conjecture could be stated.

3. PROBLEM IS OPEN

   This is a well-known open problem in the Kourovka Notebook. Even stating
   it formally would not advance mathematical knowledge since:
   - The problem is already well-understood by specialists
   - No proof or counterexample is known
   - Formalization would not provide new insights

================================================================================
CURRENT MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE:
================================================================================

PARTIAL RESULTS (all supporting the conjecture):

1. For p-primitive semifield planes of order q^4, the autotopism group has been
   shown to be solvable (Cordero, Podufalov-Busarkina).

2. For semifield planes of order p^4 where 4|p-1, it has been proved that
   SL(2,5) cannot occur as a subgroup of the autotopism group (Kravtsova).

3. For the Goologlu-Kolsch family of commutative semifields (the largest known
   family), the autotopism group is always solvable (2025 result).

4. For commutative Dickson semifields, the autotopism group is solvable.

5. For semifield planes admitting specific subgroups (Q_8, S_3, A_4), extensive
   case analysis has been performed supporting the conjecture.

NO COUNTEREXAMPLES ARE KNOWN.

The conjecture remains open in full generality. As noted in recent literature:
"There is not much evidence in favor of this conjecture, outside of some
explicit examples of semifields with solvable autotopism group."

================================================================================
COMPUTATIONAL EXPLORATION:
================================================================================

GAP (Groups, Algorithms, Programming) was used to explore relevant group theory:

1. GL(2,q) is solvable only for q = 2, 3 (orders 6 and 48).
   For q >= 4, GL(2,q) is not solvable.

2. GL(4,2) is isomorphic to A_8 (the alternating group on 8 elements),
   which is simple and not solvable. Order = 20160.

3. However, the autotopism group of a semifield plane is NOT the full GL(n,q),
   but a specific subgroup with geometric constraints. All known examples
   are solvable despite the non-solvability of the ambient group.

GAP does not have built-in support for semifields or projective planes,
limiting computational exploration.

================================================================================
WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR FORMALIZATION:
================================================================================

A complete formalization would require:

1. Define semifield algebraic structure (non-associative division ring)
2. Define projective planes from first principles
3. Define coordinatization of projective planes by ternary rings
4. Define translation planes and their relationship to semifields
5. Define regular sets and their closure properties
6. Define collineation groups as automorphism groups
7. Define the Desarguesian/non-Desarguesian distinction
8. State and prove basic properties of all the above
9. Finally state the conjecture

This represents several months of formalization work for specialized
geometric structures with limited reuse potential in Mathlib.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION:
================================================================================

This problem represents a fundamental open question in finite geometry that
has resisted resolution for decades. It is not amenable to formalization in
current proof assistants due to the specialized infrastructure required.
The problem is best approached through:

1. Case-by-case analysis of semifield families
2. Computational search for potential counterexamples
3. Development of new theoretical techniques in finite geometry

A definitive resolution likely requires new mathematical insights rather
than formal verification.
