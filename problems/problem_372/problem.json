  "problem_text": "11.80. Let G be a primitive permutation group on a finite set \u2126and suppose that,\nfor \u03b1 \u2208\u2126, G\u03b1 acts 2-transitively on one of its orbits in \u2126\\ {\u03b1}. By (C. E. Praeger,\nJ. Austral. Math. Soc. (A), 45, 1988, 66\u201377) either\n(a) T \u2a7dG \u2a7dAut T for some nonabelian simple group T, or\n(b) G has a unique minimal normal subgroup which is regular on \u2126.\nFor what classes of simple groups in (a) is a classification feasible?\nDescribe the\nexamples in as explicit a manner as possible. Classify all groups in (b).\nRemark of 1999: Two papers by X. G. Fang and C. E. Praeger (Commun. Algebra,\n27 (1999), 3727\u20133754 and 3755\u20133769) show that this is feasible for T a Suzuki and\nRee simple group, and a paper of J. Wang and C. E. Praeger (J. Algebra, 180 (1996),\n808\u2013833) suggests that this may not be the case for T an alternating group. Remark\nof 2001: In (X. G. Fang, G. Havas, J. Wang, European J. Combin., 20, no. 6 (1999),\n551\u2013557) new examples are constructed with G = PSU(3, q). Remark of 2009: It\nwas shown in (D. Leemans, J. Algebra, 322, no. 3 (2009), 882\u2013892) that for part (a)\nclassification is feasible for self-paired 2-transitive suborbits with T a sporadic simple\ngroup; in this case these suborbits correspond to 2-arc-transitive actions on undirected\ngraphs.\nC.
