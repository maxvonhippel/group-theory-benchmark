Let F be a free pro-p-group with a basis X and let R = rF be the closed\nnormal subgroup generated by an element r.\nWe say that an element s of F is\nassociated to r if sF = R.\na) Suppose that none of the elements associated to r is a pth power of an element\nin F. Is it true that F/R is torsion-free?\nb) Among the elements associated to r there is one that depends on the minimal\nsubset X\u2032 of the basis X. Let x \u2208X\u2032. Is it true that the images of the elements of\nX \\ {x} in F/R freely generate a free pro-p-group?\nN. S. Romanovski\u02d8\u0131"
