  "problem_text": "b) Let V be a variety of groups. Its relatively free group of given rank has a presentation F/N, where F is absolutely free of the same rank and N fully invariant in F. The associated Lie ring L (F/N) has a presentation L/J, where L is the free Lie ring of the same rank and J an ideal of L. Is J fully invariant in L if V is the Burnside variety of all groups of given exponent q, where q is a prime-power, q \u2a7e 4?\nG. E. Wall"
