  "problem_text": "Is it true that the union of an ascending series of groups of Lie type of equal ranks over some fields should be also a group of Lie type of the same rank over a field? (For locally finite fields the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, the theorem in this case is due to V. Belyaev, A. Borovik, B. Hartley & G. Shute, and S. Thomas.)\nR. Phillips"
