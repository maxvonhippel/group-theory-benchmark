Denote by C the class of all groups G with the following property: if U and V\nare maximal locally soluble subgroups of G, then U and V are conjugate in G (or at\nleast isomorphic). It is almost obvious that a finite group G belongs to C if and only\nif G is soluble. What can be said about the locally finite groups in C?\nR. Baer"
