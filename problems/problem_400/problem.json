Is it true that lF(G) \u2a7d f(cF(G)), where cF(G) is the length of a composition series of some F-covering subgroup of a finite soluble group G? This is Problem 17 in (L. A. Shemetkov, Formations of Finite Groups, Moscow, Nauka, 1978 (Russian)). For the definition of the F-length lF(G), see ibid.\nL. A. Shemetkov"
