  "problem_text": "A Frobenius group is a transitive permutation group in which the stabilizer of any two points is trivial. Does there exist a Frobenius group of infinite degree which is primitive as permutation group, and in which the stabilizer of a point is cyclic and has only finitely many orbits?\nConjecture:\nNo.\nNote that such a group cannot be 2-transitive (Gy.
