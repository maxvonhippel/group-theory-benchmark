We define the growth of G to be the growth of the sequence {an(G)}n\u2208N.\na) If the growth of G is exponential, does it follow that G contains a free pro-p-subgroup of rank 2?\nc) Do there exist pro-p-groups of finite cohomological dimension which are not p-adic analytic, and whose growth is slower than an exponential one?\nO.
