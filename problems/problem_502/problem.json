  "problem_text": "13.52. The dimension of a finitely based variety of algebras V is defined to be the maximal length of a basis (that is, an independent generating set) of the SC-theory SC(V ), which consists of the strong Mal\u2019cev conditions satisfied on V . The dimension is defined to be infinite if the lengths of bases in SC(V ) are not bounded. Does every finite abelian group generate a variety of finite dimension?\nD. M. Smirnov"
