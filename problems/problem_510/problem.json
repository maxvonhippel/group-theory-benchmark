  "problem_text": "A finite simple group is called a Kn-group if its order is divisible by exactly n different primes. The number of K3-groups is known to be 8. The K4-groups are classified mod CFSG (W. J. Shi, in: Group Theory in China (Math. Appl., 365), Kluwer, 1996, 163\u2013181) and some significant further results are obtained in (Yann Bugeaud, Zhenfu Cao, M. Mignotte, J. Algebra, 241 (2001), 658\u2013668). But the question remains: is the number of K4-groups finite or infinite?\nW. J. Shi"
