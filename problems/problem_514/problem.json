  "problem_text": "a) Is it true that there exists a nilpotent group G for which the lattice L (G) of all group topologies is not modular? (It is known that for abelian groups the lattice L (G) is modular and that there are groups for which this lattice is not modular: V. I. Arnautov, A. G. Topale, Izv. Akad. Nauk Moldova Mat., 1997, no. 1, 84\u201392 (Russian).)\nb) Is it true that for every countable nilpotent non-abelian group G the lattice L (G) of all group topologies is not modular?\nV. I. Arnautov",
  "answer": "a) Yes, it is true (V. Arnautov, A. Topal\u02d8a, Bul. Acad. S\u00b8tiint\u00b8. Repub. Moldova, Mat., 1998, no. 2(27), 130\u2013131).\nb) No, there are such groups with modular L (G) (Dekui Peng, Preprint, 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08269)."
