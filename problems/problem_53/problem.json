Is it true that every locally nilpotent group is a homomorphic image of some torsion-free locally nilpotent group?\nEditors\u2019 comment: An affirmative answer is known for periodic groups (E. M. Levich, A. I. Tokarenko, Siberian Math. J., 11 (1970), 1033\u20131034) and for countable groups (N. S. Romanovski\u02d8\u0131, Preprint, 1969).\nB. I. Plotkin"
