N. Zubkov, Siberian Math. J., 28, no. 5 (1987), 742\u2013747). It is also proved that a 2-dimensional linear pro-2-group in characteristic 2 satisfies a non-trivial pro-2-identity\n(D. E.-C. Ben-Ezra, E. Zelmanov, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 374, no. 6 (2021), 4093\u20134128).\nA. N. Zubkov, V. N. Remeslennikov"
