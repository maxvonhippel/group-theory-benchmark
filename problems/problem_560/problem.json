A system of points\nand lines (P, B) is a semipartial geometry with parameters (\u03b1, s, t, \u00b5) if every point\nbelongs to exactly t + 1 lines (two different points belong to at most one line); every\nline contains exactly s + 1 points; for any anti-flag (a, l) \u2208 (P, B) the number of lines\ncontaining a and intersecting l is either 0 or \u03b1; and for any non-collinear points a, b\nthere are exactly \u00b5 points collinear with a and with b.\nA.
