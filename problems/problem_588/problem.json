  "problem_text": "A group G is saturated with groups from a class X if every finite subgroup K \u2a7d G is contained in a subgroup L \u2a7d G isomorphic to some group from X. Is it true that a periodic group saturated with finite simple groups of Lie type of uniformly bounded ranks is itself a simple group of Lie type of finite rank?\nA. K. Shl\u00a8epkin"
