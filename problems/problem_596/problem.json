  "problem_text": "Let G be a group acting faithfully and level-transitively by automorphisms on a rooted tree T. For a vertex v of T, the rigid vertex stabilizer at v consists of those elements of G whose support in T lies entirely in the subtree Tv rooted at v. For a non-negative integer n, the n-th rigid level stabilizer is the subgroup of G generated by all rigid vertex stabilizers corresponding to the vertices at the level n of the tree T. The group G is a branch group if all rigid level stabilizers have finite index in G. For motivation, examples and known results see (R. I. Grigorchuk, in: New horizons in pro-p groups, Birkh\u00e4user, Boston, 2000, 121\u2013179).\nDo there exist branch groups with Kazhdan\u2019s T-property? (See A14.34.)\nL. Bartholdi, R. I.
