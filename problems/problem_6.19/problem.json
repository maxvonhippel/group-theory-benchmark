  "problem_text": "Let R be a nilpotent associative ring. Are the following two statements for a subgroup H of the adjoint group of R always equivalent: 1) H is a normal subgroup; 2) H is an ideal of the groupoid R with respect to Lie multiplication? V. M. Levchuk",
  "answer": "Not always. Let R be the free nilpotent of index 3 associative algebra over F2 on the free generators x, y. Let S be the subalgebra generated by the elements [x, y2] = x\u2217y2, [x, xy] = x \u2217(xy) = x(x \u2217y), [x, yx] = x \u2217(yx) = (x \u2217y)x, where [a, b] denotes the commutator in the adjoint group with multiplication a \u25e6b = a + b + ab, and a \u2217b = ab \u2212ba is Lie multiplication. Let M, N be the subalgebras generated by S and the elements x \u2217y and [x, y], respectively. The minimal subgroup of (R, \u25e6) that contains x and is an ideal of the groupoid (R, \u2217) equals \u27e8x\u27e9\u25e6M = \u27e8x\u27e9+ M, where \u27e8x\u27e9= {0, x, x2, x+x2 +x3}, while the minimal normal subgroup containing x equals \u27e8x\u27e9\u25e6N = \u27e8x\u27e9+ N. Neither is contained in the other. (E. I. Khukhro, Letter of July, 23, 1979.)"
