  "problem_text": "Suppose that a finite group A is isomorphic to the group of all topological automorphisms of a locally compact group G. Does there always exist a discrete group whose automorphism group is isomorphic to A? This is true if A is cyclic; the condition of local compactness of G is essential (R. J. Wille, Indag. Math., 25, no. 2 (1963), 218\u2013224). O. V. Mel\u2019nikov"
