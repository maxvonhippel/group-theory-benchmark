  "problem_text": "b) Let G be a finitely generated residually finite group, d(G) the minimal number of its generators, and \u03b4(G) the minimal number of topological generators of the profinite completion of G. It is known that there exist groups G for which d(G) > \u03b4(G) (G. A. Noskov, Math. Notes, 33, no. 4 (1983), 249\u2013254). Is the function d bounded on the set of groups G with the fixed value of \u03b4(G) \u2a7e 2? O. V. Mel\u2019nikov"
