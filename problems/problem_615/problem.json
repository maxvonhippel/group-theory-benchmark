  "problem_text": "Is it true that the group algebra k[F] of R. Thompson\u2019s group F (see 12.20) over a field k satisfies the Ore condition, that is, for any a, b \u2208 k[F] there exist u, v \u2208 k[F] such that au = bv and either u or v is nonzero? If the answer is negative, then F is not amenable.\nV. S. Guba"
