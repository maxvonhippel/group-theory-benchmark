  "problem_text": "We define the class of hierarchically decomposable groups in the following way. First, if X is any class of groups, then let H1X denote the class of groups which admit an admissible action on a finite-dimensional contractible complex in such a way that every cell stabilizer belongs to X. Then the \u201cbig\u201d class HX is defined to be the smallest H1-closed class containing X.\n\u2217a) Let F be the class of all finite groups. Find an example of an HF group which is not in H3F (= H1H1H1F).\nb) Prove or disprove that there is an ordinal \u03b1 such that H\u03b1F = HF, where H\u03b1 is the operator on classes of groups defined by transfinite induction in the obvious way starting from H1.\nEditor\u2019s comment: It is proved that such an ordinal cannot be countable (T. Januszkiewicz, P. H. Kropholler, I. J. Leary, Bull. London Math. Soc., 42, No. 5 (2010), 896\u2013904).\nP. Kropholler",
  "answer": "\u2217a) Such an example is found; moreover, for any countable ordinal \u03b1 there are groups in H\u03b1+1F that are not in H\u03b1F (T. Januszkiewicz, P. H. Kropholler, I. J. Leary, Bull. London Math. Soc., 42, No. 5 (2010), 896\u2013904). Furthermore, torsion-free examples with similar properies have been constructed (F. Fournier-Facio, B. Sun, Preprint, 2025, https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01987v3)."
