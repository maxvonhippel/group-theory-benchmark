  "problem_text": "15.65.\nA square matrix is said to be separable if its minimal polynomial has no\nrepeated roots, and cyclic if its minimal and characteristic polynomials are equal.\nFor a matrix group G over a finite field define s(G) and c(G) to be the proportion\nof separable and of cyclic elements respectively in G. For a classical group X(d, q) of\ndimension d defined over the field with q elements let S(X; q) := lim d\u2192\u221e s(X(d, q))\nand C(X; q) := lim d\u2192\u221e c(X(d, q)). Independently G. E. Wall (Bull. Austral. Math.\nSoc., 60, no. 2 (1999), 253\u2013284) and J. Fulman (J. Group Theory, 2, no. 3 (1999),\n251\u2013289) have evaluated S(GL; q) and C(GL; q), and have found them to be rational\nfunctions of q. Are S(X; q) and C(X; q) rational functions of q also for the unitary,\nsymplectic, and orthogonal groups?\nP. M. Neumann"
