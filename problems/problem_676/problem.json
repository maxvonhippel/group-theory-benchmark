Is it true that the membership problem is undecidable for any semidirect product Fn \u22cbFn of non-abelian free groups Fn?\nAn affirmative answer would imply an answer to 6.24.\nRecall that the membership problem is decidable for Fn (M. Hall, 1949) and undecidable for Fn \u00d7 Fn (K. A. Mikhailova, 1958).\nV. G. Bardakov"
