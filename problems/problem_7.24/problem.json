  "problem_text": "We say that a group is sparse if the variety generated by it has at most countably many subvarieties. Does there exist a finitely generated sparse group that has undecidable word problem?\nA. V. Kuznetsov",
  "answer": "Yes, such groups do exist; for example, a free group of N3A. By (A. N. Krasil\u2019nikov, Math. USSR\u2013Izv., 37 (1991), 539\u2013553) every subvariety of N3A has a finite basis for its laws; hence there are only countably many of them. It has undecidable word problem by (O. G. Kharlampovich, Sov. Math., 32, no. 11 (1988), 136\u2013140)."
