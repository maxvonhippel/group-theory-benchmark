  "problem_text": "Prove that the periodic product of odd exponent n \u2a7e 665 of non-trivial groups F1, . . . , Fk which do not contain involutions cannot be generated by less than k elements. This would imply, on the basis of (S. I. Adian, Sov. Math. Doklady, 19, (1978), 910\u2013913), the existence of k-generated simple groups which cannot be generated by less than k elements, for any k > 0.\nS. I. Adian"
