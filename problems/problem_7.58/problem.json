  "problem_text": "Suppose that F is an absolutely free group, R a normal subgroup of F, and let V be a variety of groups. It is well-known (H. Neumann, Varieties of Groups, Springer, Berlin, 1967) that the group F/V(R) is isomorphically embeddable in the V-verbal wreath product of a V-free group of the same rank as F with F/R. Find a criterion indicating which elements of this wreath product belong to the image of this embedding. A criterion is known in the case where V is the variety of all abelian groups (V. N. Remeslennikov, V. G. Sokolov, Algebra and Logic, 9, no. 5 (1970), 342\u2013349). G. G. Yabanzhi"
