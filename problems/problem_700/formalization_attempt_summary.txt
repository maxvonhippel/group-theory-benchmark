KOUROVKA NOTEBOOK PROBLEM 16.44 - FORMALIZATION ATTEMPT SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Is there in ZFC a countable non-discrete topological group not containing
discrete subsets with a single accumulation point? (Such a group is known
to exist under Martin's Axiom.) -- E. G. Zelenyuk

================================================================================
WHY FULL FORMALIZATION IS NOT FEASIBLE
================================================================================

1. INDEPENDENCE RESULT NATURE

The problem has been shown to be INDEPENDENT OF ZFC. The answer depends on
whether rapid ultrafilters exist:
- Under Martin's Axiom: YES, such groups exist
- In models without rapid ultrafilters: NO, such groups cannot exist

Formalizing independence results in Lean requires:
- A formalization of forcing theory
- Inner models and generic extensions
- Consistency proofs relative to ZFC

Mathlib does not currently have the forcing machinery needed to prove
independence results from ZFC. While Flypitch (a separate project) has
formalized some forcing theory, it is not integrated with modern Mathlib.

2. REQUIRED MATHEMATICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

To formalize even the positive direction (the Reznichenko-Sipacheva theorem),
one would need:

a) TOPOLOGICAL GROUPS:
   - Mathlib has TopologicalGroup, which is available
   - Neighborhood filters are available via nhds

b) RAPID FILTERS:
   - Definition: A filter F on N is rapid if for every f: N -> N, there
     exists A in F with |A intersect [0,f(n)]| <= n for all n
   - This is NOT in Mathlib and would need custom definition

c) EXTREMALLY DISCONNECTED SPACES:
   - A space where the closure of every open set is open
   - Mathlib has ExtremallyDisconnected (in Mathlib.Topology.ExtremallyDisconnected)

d) ULTRAFILTER THEORY:
   - Mathlib has Ultrafilter (in Mathlib.Order.Filter.Ultrafilter)
   - But properties like "rapid ultrafilter" would need custom definitions

e) THE KEY LEMMA:
   - That a non-rapid neighborhood filter implies existence of a discrete
     subset with one accumulation point
   - This is a delicate topological argument

3. PROOF COMPLEXITY

The Reznichenko-Sipacheva proof involves:
- Careful construction using properties of rapid filters
- Analysis of neighborhood systems in topological groups
- Connections to Ramsey theory and combinatorics on omega

This is a research-level result from 2021 that would require substantial
effort to formalize.

================================================================================
PARTIAL FORMALIZATION POSSIBILITIES
================================================================================

The following COULD be formalized in Lean 4 with Mathlib:

1. DEFINITIONS:

   def IsRapidFilter (F : Filter Nat) : Prop :=
     forall f : Nat -> Nat, exists A in F, forall n, (A inter Finset.range (f n)).card <= n

   def HasDiscreteSubsetWithOneAccumulationPoint (G : Type*) [TopologicalSpace G] : Prop :=
     exists (s : Set G) (x : G),
       DiscreteTopology (s : Set G) wedge
       x notin s wedge
       ClusterPt x (Filter.principal s)

2. THE MAIN IMPLICATION (without proof):

   theorem reznichenko_sipacheva
     (G : Type*) [TopologicalGroup G] [Countable G] [T1Space G]
     (hnd : not (DiscreteTopology G))
     (hnotrapid : not (IsRapidFilter (nhds (1 : G)))) :
     HasDiscreteSubsetWithOneAccumulationPoint G := sorry

3. INDEPENDENCE CANNOT BE STATED DIRECTLY:

   Lean proves theorems within ZFC (or more precisely, within its type theory
   which is equiconsistent with ZFC + inaccessible cardinals). One cannot
   directly state "this is independent of ZFC" as a theorem.

================================================================================
WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
================================================================================

1. Identified the problem as having been essentially solved (shown independent
   of ZFC) by Reznichenko and Sipacheva (2021).

2. Documented the mathematical content and key definitions.

3. Explained why full formalization is infeasible:
   - Independence proofs require forcing
   - Forcing is not available in current Mathlib

4. Outlined what partial formalization would look like.
