Let Kn be the class of all groups with a single defining relation in the variety of soluble groups of derived length n.\na) Under what conditions does a Kn-group have non-trivial center? Can a Kn-group, n \u2a7e2, that cannot be generated by two elements have non-trivial centre?\nEditors\u2019 comment (1998): These questions were answered for n = 2 (E. I. Timoshenko, Siberian Math. J., 14, no. 6 (1973), 954\u2013957; Math. Notes, 64, no. 6 (1998), 798\u2013803).\nb) Describe the abelian subgroups of Kn-groups.\nc) Investigate the periodic subgroups of Kn-groups.\nM. I.
