  "problem_text": "Is it true that the automorphism group Aut F of an infinitely generated free group F is a) the normal closure of a single element? b) the normal closure of some involution in Aut F? For a free group Fn of finite rank n M. Bridson and K. Vogtmann have recently shown that Aut Fn is the normal closure of some involution, which permutes some basis of Fn. It is also known that the automorphism groups of infinitely generated free nilpotent groups have such involutions. V. Tolstykh"
