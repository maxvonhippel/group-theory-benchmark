Construct an algorithm which, for a given polynomial f \u2208 Z[x1, x2, . . . , xn], finds (explicitly, in terms of generators) the maximal subgroup Gf of the group Aut(Z[x1, x2, . . . , xn]) that leaves f fixed.\nThis question is related to description of the solution set of the Diophantine equation f = 0.\nV.
