  "problem_text": "A formation F is called radical in a class H if F \u2286 H and in every H-group the product of any two normal F-subgroups belongs to F. Let M be the class of all saturated hereditary formations of finite groups such that the formation of all finite supersoluble groups is radical in every element of M. Is it true that M has the largest (by inclusion) element?\nA. F. Vasil\u2019ev, L. A. Shemetkov"
