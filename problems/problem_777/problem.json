  "problem_text": "(N. Eggert). Let R be a commutative associative finite-dimensional nilpotent algebra over a finite field F of characteristic p. Let R(p) be the subalgebra of all elements of the form rp (r \u2208 R). Is it true that dim R \u2a7e p dim R(p)?\nAn affirmative answer gives a solution to 11.44 for the case where the factors A and B are abelian.\nL. S. Kazarin"
