  "problem_text": "We say that a finite group G separates cyclic subgroups if, for any cyclic subgroups A and B of G, there is a g \u2208 G such that A \u2229 B^g = 1. Is it true that G separates cyclic subgroups if and only if G has no non-trivial cyclic normal subgroups?\nJ. G. Thompson",
  "answer": "Not always. For p1 = 2, p2 = 5, p3 = 11, p4 = 17 let Ri be an elementary abelian group of order p_i^2 and \u03c6i a regular automorphism of order 3 of Ri, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. In the direct product R1\u27e8\u03c61\u27e9 \u00d7 R2\u27e8\u03c62\u27e9 \u00d7 R3\u27e8\u03c63\u27e9 \u00d7 R4\u27e8\u03c64\u27e9 let G be the subgroup generated by all the Ri and the elements \u03c62\u03c63\u03c64 and \u03c61\u03c63\u03c6\u22121 4. Then G has no non-trivial cyclic normal subgroups and every (cyclic) subgroup of order 2 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 17 intersects any of its conjugates non-trivially. (N. D.
