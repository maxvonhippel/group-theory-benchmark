  "problem_text": "In the notation of 8.82, for r(\u03c0) > 0, one can define via Hecke algebras a formal Dirichlet series with Euler multiplication (see G. Shimura, Introduction to the arithmetic theory of automorphic functions, Princeton Univ. Press, 1971). Does there exist an algebraic Hasse\u2013Weil variety whose \u03b6-function is this Dirichlet series? There are several conjectures.\nH. Helling"
