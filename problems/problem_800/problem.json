Hartley, Yu. Kuzmin, J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 74 (1991), 247\u2013256) that the quotient (R1 \u2229R2)/[R1, R2] is a free abelian group. On the other hand, the quotient (R1 \u2229\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2229Rn)/[[R1, . . . , Rn]] has, in general, non-trivial torsion for n \u2a7e4. Is this quotient always torsion-free for n = 3? This is known to be true if r1, r2, r3 are not proper powers in G.\nR. Mikhailov"
