Can the free product Z \u2217G of the infinite cyclic group\nZ and a nontrivial group G be the normal closure of a single element?\nEditors\u2019 comments: the negation is also known as Kervaire\u2019s conjecture. It was\nproved for torsion-free groups (A. Klyachko, Commun.\nAlgebra, 21, no. 7 (1993),\n2555\u20132575) and for residually finite groups (M. Gerstenhaber, O. S. Rothaus, Proc.\nNat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 48 (1962) 1531\u20131533).\nJ. Mycielski"
