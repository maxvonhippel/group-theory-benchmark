Suppose that a finite group G has a normal series 1 < G1 < G2 < G such that the groups G1 and G2/G1 are elementary abelian p-groups, G/G2 \u223c= A5 \u00d7 A5 (where A5 is the alternating group of degree 5), G1 and G2/G1 are minimal normal subgroups of G and G/G1, respectively. Is it true that form(G) has finitely many subformations?\nV. P. Burichenko"
