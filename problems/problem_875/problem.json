  "problem_text": "18.42. For an orientation-preserving homeomorphism f : S1 \u2192S1 of a unit circle S1, let \u02dcf be its lifting to a homeomorphism of R; then the rotation number of f is defined to be the limit limn\u2192\u221e( \u02dcf n(x) \u2212x)/n (which is independent of the point x \u2208S1). Let F be a free group of rank 2 with generators a, b. For w \u2208F and r, s \u2208R, let R(w, r, s) denote the maximum value of the (real-valued) rotation number of w, under all representations from F to the universal central extension of Homeo+(S1) for which the rotation number of a is r, and the rotation number of b is s.\n a) If r, s are rational, must R(w, r, s) be rational?\n b) Let R(w, r\u2212, s\u2212) denote the supremum of the rotation number of w (as above) under all representations for which a and b are conjugate to rotations through r and s, respectively (in the universal central extension of Homeo+(S1)). Is R(w, r\u2212, s\u2212) always rational if r and s are rational?\n c) Weak Slippery Conjecture: Let w be a word containing only positive powers of a and b. A pair of values (r, s) is slippery if there is a strict inequality R(w, r\u2032, s\u2032) < R(w, r\u2212, s\u2212) for all r\u2032 < r, s\u2032 < s. Is it true that then R(w, r\u2212, s\u2212) = ha(w)r + hb(w)s, where ha(w) counts the number of a\u2019s in w, and hb(w) counts the number of b\u2019s in w?\n d) Slippery Conjecture: More precisely, is it always (without assuming (r, s) being slippery) true that if w has the form w = a\u03b11b\u03b21 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a\u03b1mb\u03b2m (all positive) and R(w, r, s) = p/q where p/q is reduced, then |p/q \u2212ha(w)r \u2212hb(w)s| \u2a7dm/q?\n D.
