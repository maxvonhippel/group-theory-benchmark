Is it algorithmically decidable whether a group generated by three given class transpositions (for the definition, see 17.57)\n a) has only finite orbits on Z?\n b) acts transitively on the set of nonnegative integers in its support?\n A difficult case is the group \u27e8\u03c41(2),4(6), \u03c41(3),2(6), \u03c42(3),4(6)\u27e9, which acts transitively on N \\ 0(6) if and only if Collatz\u2019 3n + 1 conjecture is true.\n S.
