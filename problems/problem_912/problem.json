  "problem_text": "18.84. Let \u03c0 be a set of primes. We say that a finite group is a BS\u03c0-group if every conjugacy class in this group any two elements of which generate a \u03c0-subgroup itself generates a \u03c0-subgroup. Is every normal subgroup of a BS\u03c0-group a BS\u03c0-group?\nIn the case 2 \u0338\u2208 \u03c0, an affirmative answer follows from (D. O. Revin, Siberian Math. J., 52, no. 2 (2011), 340\u2013347).\nD. O. Revin"
