A subset of a group is said to be rational if it can be obtained from finite subsets by finitely many rational operations, that is, taking union, product, and the submonoid generated by a set.\nConjecture: every finitely generated solvable group in which all rational subsets form a Boolean algebra is virtually abelian.\nThis is known to be true if the group is metabelian, or polycyclic, or of finite rank (G. A. Bazhenova).\nV. A. Roman\u2019kov"
