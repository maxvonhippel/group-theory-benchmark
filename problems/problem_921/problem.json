  "problem_text": "Let G be a periodic Zassenhaus group, that is, a two-transitive permutation group with trivial stabilizer of every three points. Suppose that the stabilizer of a point is a Frobenius group with locally finite kernel U containing an involution. Is it true that U is a 2-group? This was proved for finite groups by Feit.\nN. M. Suchkov"
