Which finite sim-\nple groups cannot be generated by two elements of orders 2 and 3?\nIn particular, is it true that, among classical simple groups of Lie type, such\nexceptions, apart from PSU(3, 5^2), arise only when the characteristic is 2 or 3?\nThe question of which finite simple groups are (2,3)-generated remains open only\nfor the orthogonal groups of even dimension 2m > 8 (M. A. Pellegrini, M. C. Tamburini\nBellani, J. Austral. Math. Soc., 117 (2024), 130\u2013148).\nM. C. Tamburini"
