  "problem_text": "Let R be the formal power series algebra in commuting indeterminates x1, . . . xn, . . . over the field with p elements, with p a prime. (Thus its elements are (in general infinite) linear combinations of monomials xa1_1 . . . xan_n with n, a1, . . . , an non-negative integers.) Let I be the maximal ideal of R and J the (abstract) ideal generated by all products of two elements of I. Is there an ideal U of R such that U < I and U + J = I?\nIf so, then SL3(R) and the kernel of the map to SL3(R/U) provide an answer to the previous question.\nJohn S. Wilson"
