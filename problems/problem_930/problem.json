  "problem_text": "Is there a finitely generated infinite residually finite p-group such that every subgroup of infinite index is cyclic?\nThe answer is known to be negative for p = 2. Note that in (M. Ershov, A. Jaikin-Zapirain, J. Reine Angew. Math., 677 (2013), 71\u2013134) it is shown that for every prime p there is a finitely generated infinite residually finite p-group such that every finitely generated subgroup of infinite index is finite.\nA.
