The group of virtual pure braids V Pn, n \u2a7e2, is generated by elements \u03bbij, 1 \u2a7di \u0338= j \u2a7dn, and is defined by the relations \u03bbij\u03bbkl = \u03bbkl\u03bbij, \u03bbki\u03bbkj\u03bbij = \u03bbij\u03bbkj\u03bbki, where different letters denote different indices.\na) Construct a normal form of words in the group V Pn for n \u2a7e4.\nb) Is the group V Pn linear for n \u2a7e4? It is known that the group V P3 is linear.\nV. G. Bardakov"
