  "problem_text": "19.13. The well-known Baer\u2013Suzuki theorem states that if every two conjugates of an element a of a finite group G generate a finite p-subgroup, then a is contained in a normal p-subgroup. Does such a theorem hold in the class of periodic groups for p > 2?\nA counterexample is known for p = 2; see Archive 11.11a).\nA. V. Borovik"
