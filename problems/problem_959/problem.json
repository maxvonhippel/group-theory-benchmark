  "problem_text": "19.18. Given an infinite set \u2126, define an algebra A (the reduced incidence algebra of finite subsets) as follows. Let Vn be the set of functions from the set of n-element subsets of \u2126 to the rationals Q. Now let A = \u2295 Vn, with multiplication as follows: for f \u2208 Vn, g \u2208 Vm, and |X| = m + n, let (fg)(X) = \u2211 f(Y)g(X \\ Y), where the sum is over the n-element subsets Y of X. If G is a permutation group on \u2126, let AG be the algebra of G-invariants in A.\nSuppose that G has no finite orbits on \u2126. It is known that then AG is an integral domain (M. Pouzet, Theor. Inf. App. 42, no. 1 (2008), 83\u2013103). Is it true that the quotient of AG by the ideal generated by constant functions is also an integral domain?\nP. J. Cameron"
