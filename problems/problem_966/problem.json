A finitely generated group G that acts on a tree in such a way that all vertex and edge stabilizers are infinite cyclic groups is called a generalized Baumslag\u2013Solitar group. The Bass\u2013Serre theory gives finite presentations of such groups. Is the isomorphism problem soluble for generalized Baumslag\u2013Solitar groups?\nF. A. Dudkin"
