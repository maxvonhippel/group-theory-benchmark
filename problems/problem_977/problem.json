  "problem_text": "19.42. Suppose that H is a word-hyperbolic subgroup of a word-hyperbolic group G such that the inclusion of H to G extends to a continuous H-equivariant map j : \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G between their hyperbolic boundaries. If such an extension exists, it is unique and j is called the Cannon\u2013Thurston map.\n\na) Is it true that for every point p \u2208 \u2202G its full preimage j\u22121(p) is finite?\n\nb) Moreover, is it true that there is a number N = N(G, H) < \u221e such that for every p \u2208 \u2202G the full preimage j\u22121(p) consists of at most N points?\n\nThe answer to both questions is \u201cyes\u201d in all the cases where the Cannon\u2013Thurston map is known to exist and where it has been possible to analyze the multiplicity of this map. This includes the original set-up considered by Cannon and Thurston where H is the surface group, and G is the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle with that surface as a fiber. In this case, j : S1 \u2192 S2 is a uniformly finite-to-one continuous surjective \u2018Peano curve\u2019.\n\nI. Kapovich"
