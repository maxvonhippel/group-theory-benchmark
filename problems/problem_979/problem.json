Suppose that for every element g of a profinite group G there is a closed subgroup Eg of finite rank such that for every x \u2208 G all sufficiently long Engel commutators [x, g, . . . , g] belong to Eg, that is, for every x \u2208 G there is a positive integer n(x, g) such that [x, g, . . . , g] \u2208 Eg whenever g is repeated \u2a7e n(x, g) times. Is it true that G has a normal subgroup N of finite rank with locally nilpotent quotient G/N?\n\nE. I. Khukhro"
