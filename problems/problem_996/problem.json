  "problem_text": "Let G be a group, and (g1, . . . , gn) a tuple of its elements. The type of this tuple in G, denoted TpG(g1, . . . , gn), is the set of all first order formulas in free variables x1, . . . , xn in the standard group theory language which are true on (g1, . . . , gn) in G. Two groups G and H are called isotypic if for every tuple of elements \u00afh = (h1, . . . , hn) in H there is a tuple \u00afg = (g1, . . . , gn) in G, such that Tp(\u00afh) = Tp(\u00afg) and vice versa, for every tuple \u00afg in G there is a tuple \u00afh in H such that Tp(\u00afh) = Tp(\u00afg).\nIs it true that every two isotypic finitely generated groups are isomorphic?\nThe answer is positive if one of the finitely generated groups is free (R. Sklinos), abelian (G. Zhitomirski), virtually polycyclic, metabelian, free solvable (A. Myasnikov, N. Romanovskii), co-Hopfian (in particular homogeneous), finitely presented Hopfian or geometrically Noetherian Hopfian (R. Sklinos). In particular, torsion-free hyper-bolic groups, braid groups, linear groups, mapping class groups of compact surfaces, limit groups, quasi-cyclic groups, Out(Fn), n > 2, irreducible arithmetic lattices (which are not virtually free groups) in semi-simple Lie groups, are of such kind (R. Sklinos).\nB. I. Plotkin"
