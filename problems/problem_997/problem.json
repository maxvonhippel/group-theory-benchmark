  "problem_text": "It is well known that varieties of groups form a free semigroup N (A. L. Shmel\u2019kin, DAN SSSR, 149 (1963), 543\u2013545 (Russian)); B. H. Neuman, H. Neumann, P. M. Neumann, Math. Z., 80 (1962), 44\u201362). Varieties of linear representations over an infinite field of zero characteristic also form a free semigroup M, and N acts freely on M (B. I. Plotkin, Siberian Math. J., 13, no. 5 (1972), 713\u2013729) A similar theorem holds for Lie algebras (V. A. Parfenov, Algebra Logika, 6, no. 4 (1967), 61\u201373 (Russian); L. A. Simonyan, Siberian Math. J., 29, no. 2 (1988), 276\u2013283).\nAre there other varieties of algebras \u0398 where the same situation takes place?\nB. I. Plotkin"
