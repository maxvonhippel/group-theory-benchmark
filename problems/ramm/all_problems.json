    "formalization_reason": "This problem cannot be formalized because it references \"assumptions (8)-(10)\" but these equations are not provided in the extracted problem statement. The conjecture asks whether these unspecified assumptions imply [s, Ns] = 0 for all s in S, where S appears to be a surface and N a normal vector, but without knowing what equations (8), (9), and (10) actually state, it is impossible to create a meaningful formalization. The problem is related to the Pompeiu problem in analysis but the critical defining conditions are missing from the extraction."
