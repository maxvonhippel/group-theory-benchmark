This problem cannot be formalized because it references "assumptions (2)-(4)" and asks whether "f = 0" follows from them, but the assumptions (2), (3), and (4) are not provided in the extracted problem statement. These appear to be equations or conditions defined elsewhere in the source document that were not included in the extraction. Without knowing what f represents and what the assumptions are, it is impossible to create a meaningful formalization.
