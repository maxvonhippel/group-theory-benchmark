This problem cannot be formalized in Lean 4 for several reasons:

1. It is an open research question that explicitly asks to "either prove (6) or construct a counterexample" - the answer is unknown, so we cannot state it as a theorem.

2. The problem requires formalizing general elliptic, second-order, self-adjoint, strictly positive Dirichlet operators, which are not available in Mathlib. This would require substantial foundational work in PDE theory that doesn't currently exist.

3. The question "Does (5) imply u = v = 0?" is inherently asking whether a statement is true or false, rather than asserting a specific mathematical claim that can be formalized as a theorem or definition.
