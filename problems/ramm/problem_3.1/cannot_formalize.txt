Cannot formalize: The problem refers to an operator T that is not defined in the problem statement. T must have been defined in surrounding context (likely introductory text on the same page) that was not captured during problem extraction. Without knowing the explicit definition of T (its domain, codomain, and how it acts on functions), it is impossible to formalize the question of whether T has finite or infinite rank.
