Cannot formalize: The problem references undefined mathematical objects L1, L2, F (a function), and "the above set S of M functions" which were defined in surrounding context not captured during problem extraction. Without knowing what spaces L1 and L2 are, what the function F is, and how the set S is constructed, it is impossible to formalize the question about linear independence of the translated functions F(z + pm).
